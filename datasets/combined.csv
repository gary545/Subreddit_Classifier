But in preparation for Ragnarok I bought GoW on PC since it was on sale and I was reminded of how Kratos literally looks perfect. I literally can't imagine skin textures and graphics becoming more realistic than this. I was looking forward to the Ragnarok trailer just for this and it seems like even on the PS5 Kratos looks as well as he did on PS4 GoW. 

How was it possible for them to create such an ahead of its time character model that it still beats anything made a whole console generation later? I seriously don't understand. If someone could ELI5 I'd be very happy.

Even TLOU2 or the TLOU remake or RDR2 despite their beauties and impressive graphics in other areas have character detail at the same realistic level as GoW has with Kratos specifically."

0,"What's the smoothest 30fps game on PS4 ? Hi, 

I am going through the PS+ Extra catalogue and one of my main red-flag for games is when they don't feel smooth, actual FPS doesn't matter because for example Death Stranding or any other Sony 1st party games feels great at 30fps, but there are many other games that just have ""jittery camera"" (Shadow Warrior 3 is the latest example I tried), and [this new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMtfexzink8) is a prime example of how bad can it look, am not saying Shadow Warrior is as bad as that, but, consider this video as the worst, and Sony 1st party games are the top of a good 30fps game.

Can you please suggest any game from the Extra catalogue that won't have smoothness issues ?

PS: 

This is not an FPS debate or hate toward anything, I just have a specific preference and am looking for suggestions from people who share the same opinion as me.

0,"My experience with the PS4 vs. the PS4 Pro and Vita streaming Hi all, 

I am writing this post not because it is particularly pertinent to anyone at the moment, but more so because I want to provide this information to those who may be in my predicament or may have this issue in the future. 

I bought myself a PS Vita a few weeks ago, and I have been absolutely loving it. As a portable gaming console, it is amazing! And while I was upset that the Vita does not offer remote-play to my PS5 (officially or otherwise), I was still very happy that it offers PS4 remote-play. However, even though my PS4 was connected directly to the Ethernet and even though I was playing my Vita right next to the router, the experience when streaming was less than great. While I did not have dropping issues or input-lag, I found that the video would often look terrible due to compression and low bit rate, especially when moving the camera at high speeds, as explained by [this Tom Scott video](https://youtu.be/r6Rp-uo6HmI).

I started to question if the issue was with the PS4, or with the Vita. The network wasn‚Äôt the issue, as I consistently have 300 down and 100 up. However, as some may know, the Vita cannot utilize 5ghz and is limited to roughly 10-15 down/up. So I figured it was one of two options. Either:

1.) The PS4 was too weak to encode and output high-bitrate video at a rate that would be serviceable to good gameplay.

or

2.) The Vita‚Äôs inability to use a faster connection makes the experience run poorly.

Because the issue was low Bitrate and not input lag or dropped or slow connection as I said above, I had a feeling that it was the former. But when I tried to research if the issue would be fixed by getting a PS4 Pro, there was no specific advice in relation to Vita remote play or my situation. While some redditors claimed that the PS4 Pro made remote-play on the phone or computer much better, that did not help in my case because it did not inform whether my issue was (1) or (2). Worse still, when asked this specific question, many redditors speculated that it wouldn‚Äôt help at all, saying that the PS4 and PS4 Pro have similar network capability so not much would change. 

Again, because I speculated that the issue was the PS4‚Äôs power, I did not believe that the network issue had any bearing on the matter. So, I decided to take a leap of faith and try and upgrade my PS4, and it was **so worth it**. 


The extra power makes a huuuuge difference in bitrate quality on the Vita. The experience is amazing, and is as if you were running the games directly on the Vita. 

Though I did not do any ‚Äúscientific‚Äù testing (which I can do on request if it‚Äôs wanted- I haven‚Äôt sold my PS4 yet), my preliminary tests are:

1.) Mafia III - Driving at high speeds (80 mph+) used to be impossible on PS4. Is very responsive, clear, and more importantly, possible, on the pro. 

2.) Spider-Man - Web swing traversal was difficult on PS4. While it was easy enough to do since the process isn‚Äôt super involved, it wasn‚Äôt very fun. On the pro, like I said, responsive and clear- very playable. 

3.) Uncharted 4 - With multiple targets, lots of gunfire and action, managing to dispatch enemies was difficult. Again, on the pro, much easier. Small targets and enemies against black backgrounds are now clearly legible, with the only limiting factor being the Vita‚Äôs low native resolution. 

4.) CoD Infinite Warfare - Basically the same improvements as Uncharted 4.

5.) AC Valhalla - The excessive foliage in comparison to other games absolutely demolishes the bitrate while streaming. All around unplayable on the PS4, and it was not worth the trouble playing. No problems playing for extended periods of time on the PS4 Pro at all. Honestly, this is probably the most remoteable game I‚Äôve played so far.

Anyway.. that‚Äôs about it. I just wanted to share my observations on the matter. As the PS Vita starts to regain some traction of interested again, I hope that this will have helped someone. While this is not entirely an endorsement to just go out and get a PS4 Pro, I consider it very useful information that is important to share for others to make informed decisions- especially when all information that exists at the moment is misleading or unhelpful.  Feel free to ask me any questions about it. Thanks!

TL;DR - Yes, the PS4 Pro provides a much greater experience when remote streaming to the PS Vita than the PS4."

My wife had been wanting for me to get a PS5 for a while and I refuse to pay scalpers so I decided to wait until plenty titles had been released and I had all the games to play when I got mine eventually. It was our anniversary and Father's day recently so she kept mentioning trying to get one. We signed up for the Playstation website list and Amazon list about a week ago. No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase. 


Tl;dr got a PS5 and changed the bundle games at gamestop.
I hope you guys get your PS5 too!"

A new [PlayStation](https://comicbook.com/category/playstation-generic/) report may shed light on a future and big console exclusive game for the PS4 and PS5. Yesterday, we relayed word of [a new report](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/playstation-ps5-pro-controller-headsets-monitors-hardware-leak/) that claimed PlayStation was preparing to reveal three new gaming headsets and two new gaming monitors next week under the branding ""INZONE."" 

Not long after we relayed this report, [Sony](https://comicbook.com/category/sony/) confirmed a special presentation is happening on June 28. Promoting this representation, it used the tagline ""Find Your New Zone,"" which is an obvious reference to ""INZONE."""

PC advantages of buying Sony games
- FREE ONLINE
- Sony may create their own steam equivalent at some point with trophy/friends list etc
- Cheaper games
- Mods!
- No need to rebuy games you bought
- Will likely have better graphic playstation games as time progresses

Playstation Advantages 
- Simplicity
- Currently the first place to get sony games

That's it...

The free online especially,  i don't see Sony going ban to how it was on Playstation 3 with free online multiplayer and I've seen a lot of awesome mods done to Playstation games that we also don't have access to.

0,"Frustrated on Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 - 199 of 200 gold bricks I know this is a buggy remake of an old, buggy game. I'm playing through with my not quite 9 year old kid, because she adores all things Harry Potter, and we both really enjoy playing together on the PS4. So, please, bear with me.

We've been going through this one and have every other achievement. All red bricks, all Hogwarts crests, all students in peril, all True Wizard, all spells learned, 199/200 gold bricks, all characters unlocked except for Voldemort.

We did snag [the tricky gold brick](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960495-lego-harry-potter-years-1-4/55458453) sweeping the floor of the emporium on Diagon Alley, which apparently is one that is easy to miss.

After the kid went to bed, I went back through I believe every ding dang room in Hogwarts. Before we got the gold brick in Diagon Alley, the brick detector was going off in Diagon Alley and in both rooms of the emporium. After, the only rooms where a detector went off were the library and restricted section, which I know to be [a bug with the house crest detector](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/a01e9w/help_me_please_1_gold_brick_left_to_get_years_14/).

So. Are there known areas out there where the gold brick detector does not function as designed, where this last brick might be hiding?"

The title is self-explanatory, but some context:

I bought the game last night on my PS4 and played it for ~3 hours. Love at first sight.

Then I woke up early today, really excited to play the game before work.

Once I hit ""Continue"", it takes forever to load. In fact, it hasn't loaded yet. First time I waited 5 minutes and thought something was wrong. Closed the game and opened it again.

Now I just looked at my stopwatch app... OVER 25 MINUTES to load the game!

I've never seen anything like that in my whole life playing video games. I'm not playing on a PC with low requirements, it's a PS4. The game is sold for the console.

I only played a few hours, but I hope I won't have to reinstall it because I don't have PS Plus and I would lose my save data."

So I'm new to owning a PS4 Slim(2018 CUH-2216A), i got it from my uncle after he bought himself a PS5

I've come to experience some different noises in the span of me owning it, mostly when it's in idle mode on the homescreen (quiet grinding noise from the disc drive, hdd noises). I've read online that these noises are somewhat common and not a cause for concern but I'm still worried that the console might have some problem.

I would just like for someone to please list the different noises they've come to experience, and when to know if it's a problem or when it's a normal noise...just for some reassurance and advice sothat I can sleep peacefully at night."

I get that there are some good exclusives, in fact I 100% Spider-Man within a week or two and it wasn't even the only thing I played, but I dont see those few games as reason to prefer a whole console.

0,"PSA: TMNT: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge has an inferior Co-op experience on PlayStation Gotta say since I barely see enough talk about this online. 

For SOME reason the PlayStation version of Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is the ONLY one that doesn‚Äôt allow more than 2 people on local to mix and match with online friends. 

I can understand only allowing up to 4 players on local since the PS4 and PS5 only support 4 total controllers. But there‚Äôs literally no technical reason for the limitations on online. 

I just tried playing online tonight with a friend and his wife and we‚Äôre both on PS5. She couldn‚Äôt join on the same console with him since the online on PS maxes out at 1 per console. 

Had we bought it on Switch instead we would‚Äôve had no issue, in our defense the 6 player online mixed with local co-op was literally an advertised feature from the Casey Jones reveal trailer that was from SONY‚ÄôS State of Play/the Official PS Blog like a week ago here: https://youtu.be/hAhoHGXPp8U

Understandably we are quite annoyed with this and it‚Äôs made even worse since we have under an hour in total playtime and Sony‚Äôs refund policy on PlayStation is trash compared to something like Steam. 

TL;DR: PS4/5 for co-op mixing online with local: the local player can only play by themselves (1 per console). There is no way to mix and match more players online with local on PlayStation. EVERY OTHER VERSION does not have this limitation. 

CAN the devs patch this feature in if enough noise is made online? I bet they would‚Äôve had it on day 1 but Sony wanted it left out for WHATEVER reason. 

If you care about having a feature rich co-op experience please choose literally any other platform and support the devs of this amazing game."

0,"PC PS Now, Recently PC Playstation Plus incompatibility with non Dualshock controllers  

So, I have a ps4 controller I usually use on PC with PS Now, but I recently got an 8BitDo SN 30 Pro+ controller because the ps4 ones' sticks started drifting. Now, the controller works great, button  mapping is  pretty  much 1:1 for the standard dualshock minus the obvious touchpad.

The problem however, seems to be a rather odd one. The SN30 Pro+ HAS a Start button, but for some reason that button doesn't register AS a start button (or have any other noticeable action) in ANY game on the  service. This usually doesn't matter for a majority of games where the Start button is just a generic pause like a lot of RPGs, but I've been coming across a lot of games where you can't even get off the title  screen without first pushing the Start button.

So what can I do besides plugging the dualshock in for random start button presses? Has anyone  else come across this kind of problem before?"

0,"Water cooling my PS4 to reduce fan noise The fan in my PS4 was noisy when playing open world games, even after cleaning the dust out of the heatsink and PSU. I found some posts where people attached large CPU coolers to the heatsink on the bottom of the PS4 and I decided to use a similar method to attach a water cooling system.

Here are some photos of my PS4 with a small water block attached to the heatsink, a water pump, a large radiator, a fan and a controller. The water pump and fan still make some noise, but it's much quieter - similar to the noise made by the DVD drive.

[https://imgur.com/a/rgQ8WS3](https://imgur.com/a/rgQ8WS3)

The photos show where I cut away the plastic from the bottom cover and heatsink cover. I used some thermal adhesive tape to attach the water block, and I attached some wires to the 12v PSU output for the fan controller. I used a double radiator, but a single one would be fine. It keeps the PS4 heatsink cool, which keeps the PS4 fan running quietly. I no longer have to play games with subtitles on!

0,"PS4 freeze with controller blinking when downloading FIX (Solution) Those of you that are having the issue with your PS4 freezing up when downloading a game.  
After a few months of trial and error I finally found a fix.  
The Problem lays in the internal HDD  
Replace your internal HDD but DO NOT MAKE AND RESTORE A BACKUP doing this will cause the problem to return just install the firmware fresh   
Back story about six months ago this started for me. At first I thought is was my external drive because when I would change ports the problem went away then would come back so I switched to another usb port it would go away and then about 3 months ago I had to switch to the third port and haven't had an issue since until about three days ago.  
So now I was at a loss of what it could be so I change the settings making the internal drive the install drive that seemed to work for a game or two but normally once it got between 6 and 10 GB it would freeze.  
At this time I was starting to notice stuttering in some games or lag so I rebuilt the database when the ps4 rebooted I get a message that GTA V is installed on both internal and external so I tell it to delete the internal version but the problem got worse it would now freeze anywhere between 4 and 6GB and when playing GTA V when exiting out of building started to take much longer than normal.  
At this point I determined it was the internal HDD failing so to do a little test I did a restore database before I made a backup and when it booted back up I got the warning that GTV was installed on both drives.  
Yesterday I went out and bought an SSD for it installed it and restored the backup (BIG MISTAKE)  
Once the restore was done all the problems were back including GTA V being on both drives.  
So I went into recovery and wiped the system but the freezing still persisted.  
So I went back into recovery and did a complete reinstall of the firmware and all issues have been resolved.  
Now I did not try reinstalling the firmware on the old HDD so those of you that are having this issue can try that and report back your results.  
I hope this info helps others."

I read there are still not many games out yet.

I have a PS4 pro that works perfectly, I keep thinking, if it is time to upgrade.

Then I think, why bother. If I didn't have a Pro, or it broke, then it would make sense, but as it is I'll keep my pro.

Maybe there are a few players who still have both set up. What are your thoughts?"

Over the last couple years I've gone deep into a few survivor games, such as The Long Dark, Green Hell, Subnautica, and recently Dysmantle.

0,"after a decade of begging for it, Ape Escape is on the PS Store With the launch of the new PS Plus, a handful of PS Classics have made their way to the PS4 Store. Among those classics is the original Ape Escape. Ape Escape was the first game to truly innovate the Dualshock Controller, it really showed just how much you can do with that design. I truly think it played a big role in modern day console controllers keeping up with the classic Dualshock design and it never gets the respect it deserves. Ape Escape has been my favorite game since childhood and to this day it is still my favorite video game. I know all the scores by heart and can say most of the English dub scripting by heart. I'm so happy to see this game get some respect for once, and I really hope that this will expose more kids to the greatness of this game. The only thing that could make this better is if someone FINALLY remasters the first 3 games. (Looking at you Toys for Bob)"

However, this isn‚Äôt the case for all the games that didn‚Äôt make the transition, as preluded by the title, some appear as though I own them, meaning they appear with only a simple download arrow, as If I‚Äôve purchased it through the digital ps store and didn‚Äôt obtain them through psnow/psplus.

And whenever I try to download these, it‚Äôs of these two results, I press the plain text download button and it loads indefinitely or it loads only for split second and then the button is greyed out, unable to be interacted with.

0,"Opinion: Sony Should Look To Capcom &amp; Square Enix For Guidance On Live-Services, Not Bungie Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I started posting opinion pieces on my blog (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post that here) and I was wondering if anyone here would be willing to provide some feedback?

Here's the link: [https://brotaku.net/2022/05/30/opinion-sony-should-look-to-capcom-square-enix-for-guidance-on-live-services-not-bungie/](https://brotaku.net/2022/05/30/opinion-sony-should-look-to-capcom-square-enix-for-guidance-on-live-services-not-bungie/)

I'm also going to attach the entire post here so you don't have to click on the link (although I'd appreciate it if you did):

Over the past couple of months Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, began to unveil PlayStation‚Äôs interest in live-service titles, something that didn‚Äôt necessarily excite PlayStation fans. Each time Ryan speaks about live-service titles it brings out a feeling of dread because the video game company that had championed singleplayer games for years appeared to be doing a 180-degree flip.

Whilst Sony Interactive Entertainment won‚Äôt be abandoning singleplayer games entirely, just essentially halving its investment in them, it‚Äôs still easy to see why PlayStation fans are concerned about this obsession with live-service titles. Live-service games aren‚Äôt always bad the overwhelming majority of them are, a good live-service game is generally the exception to the rule. Live-service games don‚Äôt respect your time, they drip-feed you content and in far too many cases, publishers put out an unfinished or broken game with the expectation that you‚Äôll stick around long enough for it to become good.

Bungie has released one of the most beloved and popular live-service titles of all time with Destiny 2, breaking free of Activision it built on its vision whilst making the game more accessible. Whilst Destiny 2 is a great example of what a successful live-service game can look like it‚Äôs not necessarily the best. Both Capcom and Square Enix have far better examples of a live-service game than Bungie‚Äôs Destiny 2. Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV could both have served as the perfect blueprint for Sony Interactive Entertainment and neither would have required a massive acquisition fee.

**The Destiny 2 Content Problem**

The biggest issue Destiny 2 has is content and how the game delivers it. It feels like everything is drip-fed and nothing is ever truly fleshed out. This approach works for some games but for most, it‚Äôs just frustrating, in the case of Destiny 2 it‚Äôs the latter. The world of Destiny is truly amazing and there‚Äôs so much potential to tell great stories but sadly Destiny 2 hardly ever manages to deliver. The Red War (base game) campaign was decent and the Forsaken expansion is probably the best story ever told in the Destiny universe but neither of these two is accessible today.

In 2020 Bungie announced plans to remove content from Destiny 2 in order to make the game easier to manage and maintain, as part of a new ‚Äúcontent vault‚Äù Bungie would continuously add and remove parts of the game. This was also done due to Bungie‚Äôs decision to increase Destiny 2‚Äòs support instead of releasing a Destiny 3. Since introducing the program, Bungie has removed paid content for the game and has essentially made Destiny 2 more unwelcoming for new players, making it seem like the game was built for the hardcore or extremely casual player.

Destiny 2 is a game you have to commit fully to and risk getting burnt out or you have to accept that you‚Äôre never going to get the full Destiny experience and play casually. In which case you‚Äôre essentially going to be repeating the same strikes or playing competitive modes. In a normal live-service game like Apex Legends or Genshin Impact that would be fine because the design is more modern whereas Destiny 2 often comes across as prehistoric. Multiplayer modes are from an era in which most first-person games have moved on from and the entire hub and map system are far too restricting.

As someone that went from Destiny to Destiny 2 and then to Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV, it became painfully clear as to just how bad Bungie have been mismanaging this series. Both Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV have issues, Monster Hunter: World has the most convoluted multiplayer system I‚Äôve ever used and Final Fantasy XIV gets overwhelming with the number of quests and information the game throws at you. These issues are minor grievances in comparison to all that Bungie get wrong with Destiny 2.

Both Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World actually respect your time and money, Final Fantasy XIV has more content in the base game than Destiny has across all expansions. Comparing expansions doesn‚Äôt do much good for Bungie either as expansions in either of those games offer a lot more than even two of Destiny‚Äòs expansions combined. It‚Äôs almost as if we‚Äôve been conditioned to accept less from Destiny 2. Then you can look at how those games manage content, neither of those games removes paid-for content or campaigns. The campaign is the player‚Äôs introduction to the world and the fact that Bungie is so willing to toss it aside is actually quite scary.

Finally, you can compare how each game is managed and this is where it feels like Bungie is giving its fans the finger. Both Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World are packed to the brim with content, Final Fantasy XIV, in particular, has more content than any game I‚Äôve ever played and yet neither of these games cut out significant quests. The only quests Monster Hunter: World removed are licensed collaborations, none of which have any real impact on the game. Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World are the two best live-service games out there and both of them were made by studios that had no major experience in the field.

Destiny 2 is an absolute mess, especially for new players. Regardless of how difficult it is to manage Destiny 2 Bungie have no real justification for cutting content, especially content that people paid for. Bungie began the live-service revolution and is among the most experienced developers in the multiplayer market so it‚Äôs quite baffling to see just how much they get wrong. Destiny 2 isn‚Äôt revolutionizing anything with its seasonal content and expansions, so regardless of difficult it is to ‚Äúefficiently update and maintain‚Äù there‚Äôs no justification for the existence of a Destiny content vault. What it essentially boils down to is laziness and publishers trying to see just how much they can get away with.

**The Core Of A Live-Service Game**

As you can see, Destiny 2 is far from the perfect, or even ideal, live-service game. Despite the game‚Äôs issues, it‚Äôs actually quite easy to fix, simple tweaks alone would make the game a far better experience. That‚Äôs because making a live-service game isn‚Äôt all that complicated, it only becomes so when developers build the game around keeping you playing for as long as possible without a care for the actual content and when monetization becomes the priority.

Reading that last paragraph you may be thinking ‚Äúif live-service games are so easy to get right why aren‚Äôt there more good ones?‚Äù Admittedly, you‚Äôre probably not thinking that but it does help with the flow of this piece. Regardless, the answer to your, or rather my own, question is that these games don‚Äôt have to be good to succeed. In most cases they simply need to work in order to find an audience, in other cases minimal effort and slapping a big name to it can also do the trick.

If you look at the moderately successful live-service games, like Fallout 76 or Dauntless, you can clearly see that you don‚Äôt need to put much into these games to be successful. In fact, both of these seem to be the blueprint publishers and developers follow when releasing one. Fallout 76 was a $60 game, lacked meaningful content and was broken at launch, post-launch it introduced a subscription model and built upon the microtransactions. Dauntless on the other hand is a free-to-play title that relies on season passes and microtransactions whilst releasing content updates every couple of months.

Neither of these games is great but they do just enough to hold your attention. That‚Äôs all a live-service game needs to do. If you look at the trends of gaming over the last 10 years it‚Äôs not really hard to see why live-service games are so popular. We went from the online craze to the era of free-to-play and whilst both of these brought about some truly terrible experiences they also introduced us to some unforgettable times. A live-service is, at least in my mind, a metamorphosis of both.

A live-service game should ideally be one where you get the multiplayer fix you‚Äôve been looking for along with the promise of it being supported for years. This on its own already sounds great but it also costs a great deal to maintain, which is why these games are often filled with microtransactions and expansions. The good live-service games either give you enough meaningful free content where you won‚Äôt mind spending a little extra money through season passes or the dreaded lootbox, or they‚Äôll give you a meaty paid expansion in which you‚Äôll get hours worth of new content.

Live-service games only really need two or three things going for them in order to find some success. It can be something as simple as character design, art style, gameplay or even just a big IP. The next big factor is accessibility, it‚Äôs no secret that a game will be more successful if it‚Äôs available on more platforms but this goes doubly so for live-service games and multiplayer games in general. Finally comes the support, something which Sony has admitted been quite poor at. A live-service game needs to be supported for years otherwise it will die off, Overwatch is the perfect example of this.

Support doesn‚Äôt just need to come from the content side but also in the way of balancing the game. Live-service games are constantly evolving. Players are always finding new exploits and meta‚Äôs, this means that developers need to stay on top of things. Something which Sony have no experience with. Regardless if we look at some of Sony Interactive Entertainment‚Äôs existing IPs you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs actually quite simple to convert some of them into live-service games.

If we take something like The Last of Us, all you need to do is build on the Factions game mode. Add some story content and create a hub and you‚Äôre already halfway there. Killzone is already primed and ready to become a Destiny-like live-service game. Dormant IPs like Resistance and Soul Sacrifice or Freedom Wars are perfect for the live-service model. Soul Sacrifice already saw a huge boom last year on Vita and a modernised version for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC would immediately find an audience.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that Sony could have begun its live-service venture without the huge investment of acquiring Bungie. It could have also done this the smart way, not by increasing its funding in live-service games to 55% by 2025 but rather by testing the waters. Going down this route would have allowed Sony to enter the market without sacrificing a huge chunk of what made PlayStation special and without spending a huge sum on money, money that could have been used to strengthen its existing development teams.

**Closing**

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bungie will be a huge help in the path Sony Interactive Entertainment is heading on. The experience Bungie has will pave the way for Sony‚Äôs live-service push but there‚Äôs also a great deal to be concerned about. Sony Interactive Entertainment has made it clear with the acquisition of Bungie, the talent retainment fund it has set aside and the creation of the Sony Interactive Entertainment Live Service Centre of Excellence that it wants Bungie to lead this push but there‚Äôs a lot that Bungie get wrong.

Destiny 2 is unkind to newcomers and casual players and it has issues with content and how it manages it. Worst of all is that Bungie doesn‚Äôt really see any of this as an issue. Sony Interactive Entertainment could very well pick up these bad habits and given that Sony wants Bungie to review all aspects of the development cycle for its live-service games it could also end up plaguing all of PlayStation Studios‚Äô live-service titles. Live-service titles aren‚Äôt bad, not when they respect your time. Destiny 2 does not and there are only so many of these kinds of games that you can play and dedicate your time to. Sony plan on having 12 live-service games out by the 2025 financial year and if they‚Äôre all run like Destiny 2 they won‚Äôt be sustainable, regardless of how different they are.

Sony‚Äôs interest in live-service games isn‚Äôt a surprise, they‚Äôve seen how much money they make from the PlayStation Network and now it wants a piece of the action. It‚Äôs just going about it the wrong way. Capcom and Square Enix have both been stepping up their efforts in the multiplayer department but they are doing so without sacrificing the core of what made them the monoliths they are. PlayStation has been breaking a legacy that it strived so hard to build with the PS4 and its obsession with live-service games is just the next step towards that."

I'm a huge fan of the humble SHMUP, a genre that doesn't get nearly enough love these days. What are people's favourite SHMUPs on the PS4, that are \*currently available\*?

I think my current top picks would have to be:

\- Sky Force Reloaded (for the sheer amount of content on there. It keeps you coming back for more and is possibly the best value for money of the genre I've ever played).

\- Shikhondo (because it might be the most beautiful SHMUP I've ever seen. Not the deepest in terms of gameplay, but everything, from the menus to the gameplay, is absolutely gorgeous)"

0,"Do I NEED a new controller? (Stick drift) So first off, this is actually about my Dualsense controller, but can't post on the Ps5 forum for some reason... 

Anyway, the same principle applies. 

So I've had some stick drift for a little while that's gotten worse and worse. I then thought, screw this, and used quite a bit of contact cleaner sprayed into the analogue stick. 

Since then, the controller has been fine. No issues whatsoever. 

I've had my eye on at least 3 games coming this year, and everything needs replacing/repairing atm - Need a plumber, new PC etc, so as money is not infinite lol, I would rather not buy a new controller that'll likely get stick drift as well soon if I can.

On the otherhand, Duelsense controllers are on sale atm at ¬£48, which a decent saving, and the sale ends soon(ish).

So yeah, can I get away with sticking with my current controller? As I say, i would really be pissed if I got a new one and it too has stick drift. 

Read so many stories of people buying the coloured ones that supposedly have better springs that also get stick drift very quickly. 

Anyway, thanks in advance."

Impressive visuals (seriously, wow!), engaging dialogues, incredible NPC's and a bunch of entertaining and rewarding quests are all part of the package.
Cyberpunk 2077 has undergone a couple of patches by now and many of the problems it had at launch are nonexistent or close to that by now.

0,"PlayStation's refund policy is straight garbage So I tell me how I purchased a game for my PS4 that was giving me issues from the start. I'm talking stuttering noises in the main menu, huge frame drops when navigating just the menu, then crashing with an error code during every loading screen. 

Reached out to support to resolve the issue rather than go straight to a refund cause I know how stingy they are with that. We went through every step and at the end the rep suggests I pay to send my console in for service despite this being the only game I have any issues with.

At that point, I felt the need to speak up and say hey, it's definitely not my console, I think this game may just be poorly optimized for PS4. I requested a refund to my account balance so that I could use it in the PSN store on a different title, not even to my original payment method cause I figured there was a better shot at going that route. 

Still no dice. Told me as per the policy, if you download or stream a game that's that. But like, how would I know a game has issues unless I try to play it? It also had decent review ratings when I looked at it in the store. When I looked up my error codes from the crashes, it specifically says ""the application stopped working,"" pretty cut and dry as far as I'm concerned, especially after having gone through all the troubleshooting steps and still having the issue. 

The rep suggested I pursue it with the game's publisher, but like, I got it on YOUR store. Aren't there supposed to be measures in place for titles made available on the PSN store? Where's the quality control? 

Every other platform where similar things have happened i.e. a game being too buggy or poorly optimized to run, once the issue persists after troubleshooting or it's been escalated to a supervisor, they issue a refund in some form. 

I didn't even want the money back in full, just store credit to go towards a different title. Steam, Xbox, hell even Nintendo who's pretty bad with customer service too will play ball. But no, PlayStation will stick to their guns to a fault and it's extremely anti-consumer and likely to lead to legal issues as time moves forward and digital refunds become the new norm. 


Tl;Dr PlayStation will not issue refunds for broken digital games."

I just bought **Lode** Runner Legacy and was amazed to find that the name of the game is spelled incorrectly on the trophy list you access from the main menu. It's spelled ""**Load** Runner Legacy"" there. The name is spelled correctly when you pull up the trophy list by holding the controller's PS button while the game is running.

Has anyone seen something like this before? It's a pretty hilarious mistake on someone's part and I guess they couldn't fix it after the game was released. I assume this would be Playstation's error and not the developer's?

The game is pretty fun. Most of the modes give it a new coat of paint with the characters, enemies, and levels having more detail, although I prefer the simpler Classic mode that gives the player that familiar stick figure appearance. 

I loved playing Lode Runner back on an Apple IIc and Commodore 64 and figured it'd be worth the $8 I paid for it on sale, which it is. That's saying something because other than maybe this game, I have almost zero nostalgia to play games that look and sound like they're from that era."

0,"PS4 Pro says it was turned off not properly when in my opinion it was turned off fine. Today I was holding 10 updates on my PS4 while at the same time I was playing some Heavy Rain, then suddenly I remembered something, so I went to the PS Store to search it up. Then my console decided to freeze and wouldn't unfreeze no matter what, so I had no other choice but to shut it off by holding the power button for 20 seconds. Upon completion and then turning on the console again, I was greeted with the checking system memory prompt followed by a restart which was followed by the warning that the PS4 was not turned off properly. I think that this is strange since this should only occur when the PS4 was closed by closing the electricity or by removing the power cable. Also I don't know if that helps but after that incident my PS4 decided to not show me my music activity and game list on my profile, rather than that everything works fine. Any ideas why that happened and if it's something worrying ? Because I am planning to buy a PS VR and some Move Controllers and I don't want to spend that much money on a broken console."

But my issue is I do not want to buy a Scuff, they are too expensive and out of my budget. And the controllers I believe I remember seeing with paddles for purchase online looked very odd in shape. And the price didn't make sense (They were often cheaper than the regular controllers).

Although perhaps I am incorrect and I am referring to a completely different thing. My request is, would anyone be able to help me find where to buy a PS4 controller with paddles (With the controller shaped as the regular default version).

0,"Graphics upscale glitch? Hi, my PS4 has developed this odd issue recently and while it may not seem so bad initially, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it crashes and the controller lag makes playing very difficult. 

‚Ä¢Upon starting the console up I‚Äôll notice more vivid colours and a sharper resolution on the menu screen. This happens maybe 1 times out of 10. 

‚Ä¢I only noticed it at the start when playing Far Cry 6. It has never done it before then. I have been playing that and Just cause 3 recently, it happens on both games.

‚Ä¢The graphics look like they have been upscaled with a sharper resolution and much better looking colours. It really looks great! 

‚Ä¢The game and system will not run as smooth however and is bad for dropping frame rate.

‚Ä¢The controller has a good second of delay between commands and anything happening in the game.

‚Ä¢It will run for approx 25-30 mins then crash. 50/50 chance of it reverting to normal or still being the same. It will keep crashing until the graphics return to normal. 

I have taken the TV out of the equation, it is definitely not the TV or monitor i am playing on. It doesn‚Äôt matter what mode the TV is on.

I've made a little list myself of some of the anime games that are on PS4 by using websites. I'm still going to continue making the list I have now but I'd appreciate some help!"

0,"Take it from someone who found out the hard way, be careful buying used PS4's out there. Found a guy selling a PS4 pro locally on facebook market place. Looked at his profile and he seemed really legit. We talked a little bit about gaming and told him I would meet him the following day at the police station. He sent me pics of it on. He sent me pics of him factory resetting it. I asked him if the disc drive worked and he assured me it did. When I met this dude he was cool. Talked about anime, Team Four Star, games. Did not strike me as the type of guy who would do someone dirty.

Well he did. The disc drive doesn't work and he deleted his profile. I went out and bought Dark souls 3 at my local Walmart. I already had a real crap day. I just wanted to chill and play some PlayStation. I was about to order some exclusives too later tonight. So now I'm out $20, I can only buy digitally, and I'm feeling like a sucker. 

Be mindful who you buy from. Make sure you can test it. If you buy on here, make sure you're using goods and services so you are protected. My first Sony Console in three year and the experience is ruined from someone who straight lied to my face. Who knew what they were doing. This one hurts. I feel seriously taken advantage of, hopeless I can't do anything about it, and it makes my faith in humanity that much harder. Don't be a fool like I was."

I'd been using the same DualShock 4 controller since 2018 but, after about 20+ hours of Elden Ring, the analog stick was becoming less responsive, which is basically a death sentence in that game. I ordered a new DualShock 4 but immediately noticed the analog sticks just feel...different. The texture on the stick seems to be a different material and the stick can be noisier when using it. I want to say it feels a bit cheaper and less comfortable on my thumb, but I realize this might just be in my head and it'll feel normally after more hours of use.

0,"Which gameplay loop is most important to you? Real quick for those who might not know:

""Gameplay loops"" are often broken down into 3 Tiers - primary, secondary, and tertiary. 

Primary = moment-to-moment gameplay, e.g. combat and transversal/exploration systems, resource gathering and mgmt, stealth, etc. 

Secondary = goals that help give purpose to or provide a means to justify the primary loop, e.g. base building, level completion, exploration of new biomes/areas, skill trees, etc.

Tertiary = the overall context and purpose for the other two loops; usually a story or clear long term goal, such as collecting all of something (stars in Mario) or getting a high score

Not *every* game includes all 3 tiers, but a great many modern games do. And if any 1 of them is missing and it's not a dealbreaker for you, clearly that's the weak link for assuring your engagement and enjoyment. 

Personally, I've stopped putting up with average-to-subpar primary loops just so I cam get through a story, even if I'm interested to know what happens next. 

Meanwhile, I'll put up with any bogus tertiary loop if I like the primary loop enough. Examples include Destiny 2, DOOM, MGSV, and Arkham Knight. But if a game's got a lot of padding in the second loop, with skill trees that have a bunch of junk options, or a bunch of collectables that don't affect the primary or tertiary loops hardly at all (looking at you Naughty Dog), I'll make it a point to finish the game faster before the primary loop overstays its welcome. 

What about you all? I feel like your favorite genre largely informs your answer, but there's a lot of variety out there so what do I know."

So as I was scrolling in the PS4 store my eyes caught upon Nioh 2 the complete edition on sale and I seen most of the game play but never gotten the chance to play that game myself except in a demo which I happily enjoy knowing that I never quite played a game like that before so I was wondering to all Nioh fans it is worth playing?

[https://www.playstation.com/en-us/sony-rewards/](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/sony-rewards/)

[https://www.rewards.sony.com/](https://www.rewards.sony.com/)

I must have signed up for it at some point because when I came across the Sony Rewards website I was like, ""Well that's a scam"". But I looked into it further and found it wasn't fake. It's directly linked to Playstation so I logged in with my Playstation credentials and sure enough, I was getting points every time I bought something off the Playstation Store for like, years now.  The rewards program *IS* linked to having a Sony-branded Credit Card, but you also get points for buying stuff off the store from your Playstation, because I definitely don't have a Sony Credit Card.

So just a heads up to anyone who might have signed up and forgot. I decided to post this on here because when checking the legitimacy of the rewards programs a lot of people on forums assumed it was fake but, never looked into it.

Investigate for yourself, and go get some gift cards and buy a new game today. The End."

0,"Resident evil 2 Remake makes my fan to go brrr. So on January 2021 I replaced thermal paste and thermal pads for my PS4 Slim, replaced factory internal HDD with WD Blue SSD. It‚Äôs always quiet when I‚Äôm playing games. Sometimes the fan will run noticeably audible in intense scenes of some demanding games after hours of gameplay, it will always fluctuate depending on the scene, but nothing like in Resident Evil 2. Ive decided to go through RE2-3 remakes couple days ago, I have disc versions.

As soon as I load my save file and go in to gameplay, the fan of the console just constantly runs loud, very noticeable. It doesn‚Äôt change its speed, just constantly high. Not on highest RPMs but I never heard my console to take off like that before. As soon as I exit the game and close it, the fan would subside, even though I just launched RE2R and loaded my save after console startup.

I opened up my console to see maybe there is some dust accumulated, but there is none, radiator is fine. Console located at the space with a lot of airflow.

I assume it‚Äôs just RE Engine and a game itself that pushes console APU, fan sensor recognize the load and launch Fan on medium-high RPMs.

I played RE2 for 5 hours now, never got any overheating messages, console pushes warm/hot air from the exhaust as it should, it‚Äôs just a fan that runs very audible. Console is warm to the touch, which is normal. No Throttling and frame drops, game actually runs surprisingly well and looks amazing with HDR enabled.

I just want to ask anyone who played this game on their PS4, did you encountered same issue? I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable for me to go through Thermal paste replacement and pads after such short timeframe only because of this game. I expect at-least 4 years of its thermal interface to work properly, even though Arctic claim to have 8 years of high efficiency for their mx-4 thermal paste."

I had deleted Facebook after completing the deal as I only downloaded it to buy a ps4. I didn't know that the ps4 had a disc in it and found out when asking my friend why there was a picture of a disc next to the game. Turns out, there was a disc. I found this out about 3 weeks after buying the ps4. I re-install Facebook and messenger to find out the seller messaged me 2 weeks after we completed the deal. He wants the game back and is offering $80 for it because it has ""sentimental value"" with his girlfriend. I agree and he agrees to come. He changes his mind and demands I gave it back because I ""Stole"" the game. He demands I go to him and give him the game with a written letter of apology. Call me a asshole for wanting the money, but I saw an opportunity and took it. Sorry that I'm a terrible human being. Anyway, I panick and block him. Please be kind and give me some advice. Will I get in legal trouble? He has my address and phone number. I can provide photos of the conversation.  Sorry if I'm being rude, I don't use reddit but I  need advice."

0,"wrongfully banned! Hi guys im pretty new here (to both¬†r/ps4¬†and reddit itself).

So some backstory i have had a ps4 for over 5 years now. I invested thousands of dollars on it and have been very loyal to the playstation brand. The whole incident started back in january 2022, ""Locker reveal"" videos in fortnite were becoming very viral on youtube so i decided to give it a shot. I made a video and uploaded it and it got over 3,000 views which isnt much but it was my most popular video on my channel, i say was because i had to delete it (you'll see why).

A few weeks after i uploaded the video (18th of february to be exact) i turned on my playstation and saw the ""sign in to playstation network to use the online features"" error. As any normal person would i thought it was a regular software update, but then i checked my email and the last email i had got said ""sign in id changed"" this was not the first time my account had been compromised so i knew exactly what to do. I contacted support and within an hour i had my account back, i noticed the ""hacker"" had made himself at home because he removed like 50 of my friends and added a lot of his and was bragging about how he ""nagged some rich kids account after seeing it on a youtube video"" (mind you im not rich). After seeing this i instantly changed the youtube video's privacy to private so no one else could see it.

The very next day though the ""hacker"" hacked it again. Unfortunately this time though when i contacted support they had other plans... they said my account had been locked and no changes could be made to it for 7 days. After the said time i contacted them again and the process was simple enough you know date of creation ps4 serial number etc and i got it back.

This time though i decided to have a chat with his friends. I asked them who he was and no one replied except for this one guy ""anxoss-"" (that was his psn online id) he said he is a (please excuse my language here) A 14 year old √üƒ∑ ≈à√• who lives in michigan. I was shocked to see his language but i continued and asked him to keep it pg. He showed me his face (which i am 100% sure was fake and just a african american child's photo from google) i decided to block te guy and tell my best friend who was messaging me through ps messages why i unfriended her, but before i could i saw there was another friend of mine who had said ""i am reporting you"" as the last message. I decided to check it out amd shockingly the last words on there from my account (which the hacker wrote) were the ones i mentioned above. The conversation went something like; shut the fk up you na go k*l yourself. I saw this i freaked out because he said im reporting you.

This is where my mistake comes in because then and there i should have contacted psn support and told them all about this, but i decided not to.

The very next day when i logged on it read "" your account has beed permanently suspended due to violence of playstation's code of conduct"".

None of you have any idea how much heart rapidly started beating, i though i was having a heart attack.

I contacted support (this time via call) and fully explained myself as to how the ""hacker"" used hate speech and tge guy who he used it on is a friend of mine, but to no remorse, because the only answer i got from support was ""our team makes thorough checks before banning a players account so this desicion is irreversible, we suggest you create a new account to start playing again"".

This was none of my fault. One stupid video to try to get viral landed my account getting banned. 5 years of grinding of 10,000 hours of play and almost 14,000 usd in expenses all down the drain.

If there is anyone that knows a solution to this please do let me know please üôè. Its not that i lost my money and progress i feel like i lost a piece of myself."

I expected this to happen but, I really want to experience PlayStation exclusives like Spiderman and Ghost of Tsushima.

The ps4 tells me something about not recognizing the disc and to clean it but I‚Äôve tried it already multiple times. I‚Äôve tried multiple discs and multiple methods but nothing works. I‚Äôve also restarted it and that hasn‚Äôt worked either. Idk if to return it or if there‚Äôs a way to fix this or idk

I don't care about the free games most of them are garbage hey most of you may like paying and can always afford it I mean that's like me paying to just wake up in the morning makes no sense ps3 had plus but it didn't stop you from going online so say if you want a ps4 right you go out and buy It , you buy the first game with it and then turn around and buy ps plus let alone digital ps4 games and then there's in game store currency which isn't a problem it just adds up what you have to pay if you want to be online free go to PC other wise in my opinion you're giving rich people money it's worse if you're an online gamer I'm sure they know people who have bills to pay why the hell are they forcing you to pay to play online it's nothing but money snatching i need an explanation oh BTW their thinking of bumping the subscription too figured I'd throw that out their the membership is just another bill added to you're total you're already paying you're gas and light bill phone bill and now a ps plus bill lmao"

0,"Just imagine that the next gta will be released for 8th gen consoles What Are Your Expectations for the next gta game ? With the success of GTA 5, Rockstar Games have become synonymous with amazing story telling.

Players expect GTA 6 to be able to satisfy their need for a compelling storyline. Rockstar has made iconic games like GTA San Andreas and even GTA 4, which have changed the way players look at games.

They have given games more of a movie-like feeling where the players get to play through a movie and fans want a heightened experience of the same in GTA 6.

Players are done with pre-assigned protagonists in GTA. With the release of Cyberpunk 2077, players saw a new approach to having a life path in the game.

Players get to enjoy a diverse gaming experience by choosing different life paths, making each choice different based on what life path they choose at the beginning. Players would love to see GTA have such a system in GTA 6 as it lets players pick a unique start to their personalized story.

And my other expectations are the revisiting the old map option and also telling the story of the old gta protagonists and hopefully a new combat system

For a button that is exponentially larger than any others on the DS4, it‚Äôs a bit sad how underutilized the track pad has been. 
It takes up so much real estate, and ends up usually being a map shortcut, if anything at all. What are some games that actually used the pad in interesting ways?

Risk of Rain let you use it like a mouse, to hover over items on your HUD that would bring up info about them. I always thought this would be a good general use for it, but I barely ever see it.  
Dreadnaught uses its ‚Äúswipe‚Äù functions to quickly divert power to shields/weapons etc for each direction. A useful shortcut at least.
Concrete Genie and Tearaway both use the trackpad to make designs in game I believe, cant quite recall if worked really well or not."

I do however have a PS4 for some of the exclusives and at some point downloaded Bloodbourne when it was super cheap. I had no idea that the game belongs to the dark souls universe and after dying for 30 minutes I put it aside. A while later I bought Sekiro (again not informing myself properly) and after 2 hours of really struggling I put it aside. Now you are thinking what a noob.... Well I am gaming now for more than 25 years and would consider myself at least average but have mainly played shooter and sports games on both PC and console. Anyways, when Elden Ring was released I couldn't hold back and bought. Absolutely loving it and in the meantime also understood how to play the game. This brings me back to my question, which dark souls should I buy and play? Is there one specifically that is worth it on PS4 and that still holds up nicely after years of release? Of course I will try to get back into Sekiro and Bloodbourne as well. Thanks"

0,"Does anyone feel this way too while playing story based games ? Hey guys, 
Before I start, I want to give some insight about me in case that helps. 
I‚Äôm a 27 years old guy, I love video games, I love collecting steelbooks, collector‚Äôs edition version of games, figures, etc.. 
I always buy the latest consoles, currently I have a PS5 and Xbox S/X along with the Oled Switch. 
My problem is I can‚Äôt start playing a new game unless I am 100% sure that nothing is gonna come up to interrupt the gaming session, this only applies to story and adventure based games such as (Horizon zero dawn, Final fantasy, ghost of Tsushima etc..). If a certain thing happened during the day I play such a game, I would stop playing it for like a week or a month, then find it hard to go back to where I left off, so I will have to restart the whole game to catch up and remember the things I forgot, even if I only left for two or three days I will still do the same thing and restart the game all over again just to be able to follow up, and and story keeps happening over and over again with every game I buy or try to play. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my anxiety, or is it because I‚Äôm suffering from severe depression although I know that gaming is the only thing that gives me some relief, but being hesitant to play a certain game that I love just because I‚Äôm worried something he‚Äôs gonna show up and will force me to stop playing and restart the game later on after a week or two or three or a month. For example I am yet to play God of war, assassin‚Äòs creed Valhalla, Control, etc although these games were released long time ago. And this thing is really bothering me because every time I go back to play a game I left for a week or two I end up dumping the whole game just because I forgot the plot and I don‚Äôt wanna restart the whole game all over again. 

Does anyone else suffer from the same issue, or is it just me? 
Please share your thoughts maybe it can help me, since I‚Äôm slowly starting to feel that even the only thing that used to give me some relief (Gaming) has been making me super anxious for the last couple of years because of the issue I‚Äôve mentioned before. 

This is my first time ever writing on Reddit, so please no need to be rude or troll me regarding this matter, and English is not my first language so there might be a lot of grammar mistakes. 

Thank you"

I can tell because for some weird reason they only ever had Resistance 3 and not resistance 1 and 2. 

Now that they finally released the list of classic games yet again it only shows Resistance 3....

Have they made any attempt in updating the classic catalogue? It seems to be the exact same...unless Im missing something here?

0,"Alternate d pad location I‚Äôve been playing several games recent where the d pad might be needed while using the left stick to move around, namely AC Odyssey or Horizon Zero Dawn /Forbidden west. 

For example I‚Äôve found myself several times frantically running from a machine while searching through my pack trying to scroll across to the health potions or hit up for healing in the horizon games. Or in AC odyssey I‚Äôve found it annoying to have to stop every time I use the pulse to search ability. 

The thing is, the only way I‚Äôve found to do that while still moving around is to twist my left hand so I can use the inside of my pointer finger to tab up or to the side with the d pad while running away with the joystick. Seems inconvenient considering how often you need to dodge while recovering: letting go of the ‚Äúlook‚Äù stick is fine, but stopping completely while trying to locate an item is a bit different. the control combos for games are getting more and more nuanced with each Gen of console, with combo buttons for varying attacks instead of just spamming the square button or right trigger, and that seems to be a huge limitation since the left needs to almost be constantly used to move.

I was wondering if it was possible to have a controller with either the primary D pad or a secondary d pad on the back of the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù of the controller for your middle or ring finger to accessI mean 90 percent of the time my fingers are just sitting there anyways, as my hands are big enough that I don‚Äôt need all 3 other fingers for the grip, so my middle finger is kind of just resting across the bridge anyways. And it‚Äôs not like people ever look at the controller while they‚Äôre playing anyways, and fine movement won‚Äôt be exactly needed for a basic d pad you use sparingly. Maybe for weapon switches, or to allow more combinations of attacks. 

Curious whether people have thoughts on this concept, or have found other solutions for this type of problem."

I also recently played the Guardians of the Galaxy game and thought it was AWESOME for what it was. I also tried playing Red Dead Redemption 2, even though the first ones mechanics drove me nuts, and havent been able to force myself to play it till it supposedly got better, it just hasn't grabbed my attention. I have also tried Outer Worlds, and was unimpressed with that as well and was just massively underwhelmed. I tried death stranding but was also let down, it was visually stunning but the gameplay was just so damn slow. I was looking forward to Cyberpunk, but after all the issues and it seems like the fixes theyve implemented are more for ps5 than ps4 so Im not sure about that. All in all, Im just looking to find a new game that will grab my interest, thats mostly pretty, has alot to do (not a need but like, Horizon? Horizon had a good amount to do), and has a decently gripping story. Am I out of luck? Am I asking too much? Anyone have any recommendations on a game thatll makes life worth living for a bit?"

There's  the trophy related to obtain 5 shields while already having one and i  am also doing the X10 multiplier trophy for arcade mode.

The  question is: Should i use dash on every asteroid and get whatever are  in them, or is it suggested to blow em up in pieces without dashing to  get the green bonuses from inside individually?

Also, should i boost through the points bonus or pick em one by one and save me a dash?

Any other suggestions to keep in mind to obtain these?"

0,"Legit Check ""Used"" PS4 Controller Hey guys, about a month ago I bought a DS4 for around 25 USD (converted from my currency) from a site equivalent with ebay.

I don't actually own an PS4, I'm just playing on PC using DS4Windows.  Out of curiousity I'd like to know if this controller is legit or not. 

Good news:  
\- I tried [gamepad-tester.com](https://gamepad-tester.com) on both my laptop and phone, showing up as:

    Sony PS4 Dualshock Wireless Controller (STANDARD GAMEPAD Vendor: 054c Product: 09cc)

\- Buttons work and feel great

\- Battery lasts a whole day of playing

\- Headphone jack works stereo and sounds good 

&gt;*I don't use the headphone jack often but I just tested it because I heard a lot of people complaining about fakes having bad crappy audio*

\- Pairs pretty fast

\- Doesn't take too long to charge

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I would think it's **legit**:

\- The seller had a lot of products on her page (not just controllers) and the selling page was also promoted (*promoted meaning the the seller payed a monthly subscription and when a user types ""PS4 Controller"" in the search bar the seller's page will show up in the top items*).  I asked her charging the controller for me to test it when it arrives at my house. (In my country there's an option to check the packages and the courier will wait patiently watching you decide whether or not you're happy with the product delivered, I was happy seeing the controller connected bluetooth to my phone and working fine so I accepted the parcel and gave the money to the courier).

\- On the official **About DS4Windows** page it says that complete replicas of the ds4 just **may** work, meaning that this is either a legit controller or a perfect replica.

Reasons I have my doubts:

Well, the thing is that I never tried opening a DS4 controller until now and I have zero knowledge of legit checking the internals. Maybe someone more experienced with this stuff could tell me:

\-Risk of rain 2: Apparently a great roguelike. Seems like it'd be great if I could convince my friend to get it. I've heard that it's buggy on console though. As far as Roguelites go, I'm not really enjoying Hades, but Slay the Spire is fantastic

\-Rainworld: Looks very interesting and unique. But I've also heard it's very frustrating

\-Celeste: Apparently a great game. Not sure I'd enjoy the story that much since I've been fortunate enough to never suffer from anxiety/depression, and the story seems to be presented as one of the main selling points"

0,"any fun racing game for PS4? Back in late 90' I loved playing n4s 2 and hot pursuit with my best friend (all day and night, we were insane), but ok that's unplayable today. The last fun racing game I played was n4s most wanted on PS3, first time played all night, finished and platinumed.

 Since then not many interesting games. I have dirt rally, dirt 2.0, dirt 5, gt sport, ride 3, wipeout Omega, onrush, all n4s except heat, tried Payback today and didn't liked it.

I'm interested in grid legends (however, Gran Turismo was always nice cars but kinda boring so I'm not sure about gt7) but I'll wait until price is under 20$. If I was sure I'll play long i would pay full price.

I love rally in real life but unfortunately PS4 games are kinda boring. Never was a fun of F1, but heard they're good games, tried some on PS3 but couldn't get into it.

Ride 3 is good game (hard too) but since I'm riding motorcycles in real life I can't help but chuckle, handling is just fake and wrong so I deleted.

I'm not sure about assetto Corsa, afraid it's not gonna be fun.

Should I give gt sport another try?  Or any suggestion about another game?"

0,"Don't casual gamers have space anymore in the gaming community? It's been a while since I always see people on the internet saying that if you don't play on PC you aren't a gamer or aren't not enjoying videogames on the right way, or that consoles are a waste of money and time etc, and the same shit as usual.

Why did playing on a console become so wrong for the gaming community? I usually only use this sub, the PS5 sub, and r/truegaming to talk about videogame because on other subs it's always so difficult to have a nice talking after you say that you play and like to play on a console.

I'm 23 years old, I got a job, a gf who I love, videogames aren't anymore the most important thing in my life. I'm not a kid or a teenager who can spend all day playing video games. I'm now an average worker who just wants to relax on my couch after a long day of work and go out with my gf at the weekends. I don't even play online anymore (except for some casual mobile games with my gf)

People need to chill more. Videogames are just a fun way of entertainment, you don't always need to buy a gaming pc to play everything with the max specs possible or fill your game with mods. I mean, of course, I like those things, but I don't really care that much to invest all my money on a gaming pc. I don't have that much free time to spend hours modding a game or playing online the entire day.

There's still life out there and it seems people don't know that anymore and think everyone needs to be a hardcore gamer if they like to play without any commitment. I still have my Switch and my PS5 and I'm happy with that, and while consoles are still a thing, I'll keep buying them."
0,"Cool open-world games I'm looking for a new game that's playable on the ps4. My favourite games are open world games that have interesting character development and storyline, and beautiful scenery I can escape to (whether that is sweeping landscapes or post apocalyptic cities taken over by nature). I like exploring, collecting loot, some puzzles (but not essential) and some fighting, be it shooting or slashing. I'm not good at remembering lots of fighting combos though, and I don't like first person shooters like Call of Duty. 

My favourite game ever is Red Dead Redemption 2 ( not in first person mode) because of excellent characters that I cared about, storyline, beautiful scenery, lovely horsey, seemingly endless places to explore and things to do and collect, the astounding level of detail and choices, and lots of other reasons. 

Other games I love in order are The Last of Us 2, The Last of Us, Journey, The Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West games. 

I'm coming to the end of my current game and need your advice. It would really help me (only if you have time) if you could say why it/they might be the game(s) for me. Thank you so much in advance,¬† I will look into every idea."

-Kingdom Come; I did not expect to spend 100hrs playing this, but the story and setting were so immersive, and the mechanics alluringly obtuse.
-No Mans Sky; I was not on board when the hype train crashed, and only started playing about a year after release with no expectations. Exploring its universe was fascinating, I thought.
-Nidhogg; As simple as this game looks, it had our whole living room cheering and booing, during tense back and forth showdowns. Hosted a few local tournaments even, in the beforetimes.
-Apex Legends; I don‚Äôt play online often, but I got into this with a small crew when it dropped and it was our entry into battle royales‚Ä¶ We eventually got some team wins together and it was exhilarating, but I don‚Äôt think any other game has made me as tense or anxious.

They let you breeze through on easy mode but then you get to the end and they're almost impossible to beat. Especially when you're playing with a 6 y.o. I don't have time to git gud. That's why we play on easy.

Last night I must have tried to beat Dr. Nefarious maybe 15x and I'd get soooo close but run out of good ammo so I was basically powerless. My son kept asking, ""Uh, can we go to another planet?"" I said something like, ""Well, when things are hard, we don't give up.""

Yeah, he's getting a good lesson out of this, but I can teach him that in other ways. We're just trying to have fun during our game time, and we have been up until this point where now it feels like work.

0,"[PSA] Pro Tip: In Tribes of Midgard, if you are unable to join your friends' group - check your router settings... So, over the weekend my friends and I were excited to play Tribes of Midgard together...the one issue is that a few of us were never able to join groups reliably.  We would constantly get the ""unexpected error occurred when joining the group"" error

  
Well, thankfully one of the group members works in IT/networking and suggested it might be the router causing an issue.  It was a long shot, but worth testing.

So, I disconnected my PS5 from the router and connected it directly to the modem, and what do you know! It worked perfectly!  I could host and join groups with no problem!

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are constantly getting this error, please look up how to set up port forwarding on your router.  It will entirely resolve this issue for Midgard, and possibly resolve some other issues you may have had online as well

Here is a link to learn how to do this: [https://portforward.com/playstation-4/](https://portforward.com/playstation-4/)

The characters are fully realized. The banter between them is hilarious and adds a lot to each mission. The combat and game design isn‚Äôt revolutionary. But it really does feel like you‚Äôre on an adventure with your friends. I don‚Äôt think any other group oriented RPG has achieved quite this level of camaraderie with its characters. 

So if you can find Guardians for a decent price somewhere, you should give it a shot. It really is a lot of fun."
0,"Factory Reset PS4 &gt; Log into account without updating firmware, possible? Hi all, I have done a search but can't appear to find anything specific to this case.

I have just bought a used PS4 and it's on version 8.2 firmware. I know this is exploitable, I don't want to do that now but maybe in the future.

My question is can I do a factory reset, log into my account so I can track any trophies and stuff and not update the firmware?

The PS4 will primarily be offline as it is going to be kept in a place with no internet for occasional use and I will only be playing physical discs. I have got a PS5 at home as my main console.

Any help appreciated."

0,"My PS4 Pro has gradually become more unstable lately and it's driving me nuts. Anyone else? When I'm browsing games on the PS4 Store - with nothing else open - the Media tab won't even load properly most of the time.

If I want to look at screenshots of the game (that thumbnails prove the existence of), they won't show in full screen.

Or when I'm scrolling, it'll randomly freeze up. Then I get a ""Please wait"" sign, and it throws me right back to the top of whatever collection I was looking at, which can easily be hundreds of titles.

That happened **FIVE TIMES** today when I was just scrolling through the Deals.

When I'm on YouTube, the video and audio can freeze. Then, the PS4 revs up like it's rebooting or recovering from a crash (you know the sound). Home screen music starts playing... except I'm still stuck on YouTube with the frozen video and unable to control it.

Holding the power button down does nothing, so I have to unplug the console from the wall and plug it back in.

What's going on with the software team over there? I'd like to be able to use YouTube and browse your Store without the console shitting itself several times every hour.

I don't wanna be that person who screams ""planned obsolescence"" at the first inconvenience on an older platform, but I don't like the backwards steps since PS5's launch.

Shit ain't been the same since that God-forsaken 8.00 firmware update. And we *still* don't have Apple Music and Wishlists on PS4."
0,"Headphones microphone does not work on ps4 Hello!

I have Steelseries Siberia 800 headset which is wireless. They work without any issues on my PC.
1.5 years ago I used them on my ps4 and they worked there as well without any issues.

I wanted to get back to ps4 gaming but for some reason my microphone will not work. I'm using them daily on my PC and there are no issues.

In ps4 it even says in my audio settings that microphoned are set to the siberia headset but no audio comes out of them. I can hear fine I just cannot talk to anyone.

I'm really confused as to why it's not working, anyone got a clue?

TL;DR: I'm using Steelseries Siberia 800 wireless headset. Used to work on ps4 around 1.5 years ago. Now I can only get sound but my microphone will not be picked up. (Still works perfectly on PC)"

0,"My fellow sports games fans, which of the upcoming soccer games are you most excited for and why? So, by now, we know that we are entering a pretty wild and weird time for fans of the beautiful game. For years now, soccer games have been almost exclusively just FIFA and PES. Both required the yearly $60ish investment for mostly a roster update and maybe a couple new features and gameplay upgrades.

In the (hopefully near) future, we the gamers will have at least 5 new games to choose from! Those games will be EA Sports FC, FIFA's rival to EASFC, eFootball, UFL and GOALS. The latter 3 are/will be free to play which I assume that EASFC and its rival will continue to do yearly releases at a $60ish price point.

Personally, I've already given up on FIFA, so EASFC and it's rival aren't for me. I'm excited to see where these other companies choose to take the idea of a soccer game. It will be very interesting to see what sort of features, animations, game modes, etc get included in order to give each game its own unique feel.

eFootball is already available for free and while it's definitely rough around the edges (and there honestly isn't very much content right now) it's a nice change of pace from what FIFA is. Over time I'm sure it'll get even better to compete with FIFA, at least in the short term.

All that being said, I just wanted to find out which of these y'all are most excited for. For me, it's GOALS! On paper, they seem to have a ridiculously cool concept and I think if they manage to pull it off and simultaneously deliver a game that feels satisfying to play, then they'll run away with the market. If you haven't already, definitely check them out to see what sort of ideas they're wanting to bring to the table! Share your thoughts on how you think the soccer game landscape will change in the coming months/years!

P.S. yes, I also posted this in the ps5 subreddit but I really wanted to hear what y'all have to say!"

So I connect the USB from the card to the pc and the ps4 hdmi cable to input and finally hook a hdmi from the output of the card to my display. I then open obs and it works I can see and hear my ps4 through obs. However when I go to switch the input on the display to the capture card it shows no signal.

I've googled the problem and it seems the way to fix it is to turn off HDCP so I do that and the display still shows no signal but obs still has video of the system. I restarted the system and also have had the same result.

I know the card works because it does what it is supposed to do with my ps3 and ps2.

Anyone have any ideas?"

This mf gets away with saying the nastiest shit and I get locked out.



Side note: why tf can PlayStation lock us out of games we already own and paid for? Isn't that..idk like stealing? 

And speaking of stealing. About a year ago someone got into my account, bought a bunch of games and changed the password. After a horrendous time getting my account back a few months later I get locked out again because PlayStation didn't acknowledge that I wasn't the one that bought the games. So once again I'm having to contact my bank, going through three different committees of review from PlayStation, All for them to say oops. They did absolutely nothing to help bring justice or catch the culprit. So I bet you that MF is still out there doing the same shit.

0,"Ghost of Tsushima (Caution Spoilers) Fist I would like to say this is one of the best games I have played in awhile.  
There are a few things that irritate me in this game first of all the wild bores they will just disappear once you kill or severely injure one its like once you turn the camera angle away from them and turn back they are just gone and this is in a wide open field.   
Another thing I noticed is further you get along in the game the more glitches that happen.  
One of the most irritating glitches is when fighting (This only happens at random and stated halfway through act II) you cant hit crap you face the enemy swing your sword and you swing and miss because your character moved to the right or left to the enemy. This gets frustrating when you are dealing with multiples of enemies.  
Another bug is with the blow darts if you are standing above the enemy they will not work or if you are too far away but it shows them hitting their target.  
the best glitch I ran into was one of the enemies got stuck on stone stairs and was constantly shooting you with the hand cannon but when you ran up to him to hit him your sword just went right through him like he wasn't even there. when I threw a sticky bomb at him it just dropped off him and rolled but luckily when it went off it was still close to him and killed him.  
Another cool glitch is in the ocean if you jump just before you swim you will slide across the water for a couple of seconds before falling into the water 

Now the biggest screw up by the devs is iki island if you play it late in the game (Like I am) your character calls your horse by your dead horses name     
I may sound like I am raging on this game but honestly I give it a 10/10 I am an old school gamer so I don't expect games to be perfect and I recommend this game to all my friends."

0,"Dilemma about my psn account I made my psn account in 2010, back then my country didn't have psn service, so I had to pick another region, I don't remember why, but I picked UK, over the years the prices in the uk store kept increasing, eventually I made a usa alt account, for which I bought psn + and games, and shared them with my main uk psn, I've been playing like that until now.

the problem is that with ps5 and sony deciding to make their services more strict, for example removing the ability to transfer save files to an external drive, and cloud services being strict to the psn + user only, it's starting to give me trouble, if my uk main doesn't have a psn +, I won't be able to save any game files.

on the other hand, psn + and games in general cost much less in the usa store, to the point that even if I get a uk psn +, it won't be worth buying any games there, because usa prices will still be cheaper. 

it comes down to either discarding 10 years of progress and trophies and quitting my main uk account and having to start over, or pay more for psn + and games on the uk main account, while I can pay less for the same thing on the usa alt. 

what would you guys do? I'm really not sure, dumping 10 years of progress and starting fresh is quite brutal."

0,"I might just pick up a PS4 this summer. I know, the PS5 is out already, but I missed the boat with the PS4.  Other than Tales of Graces the last Playstation console I played was PS2, which I loved (beat about a dozen and a half ps2 RPGs).  I do have a switch (Ni No Kuni 1/2, Tales of Vesperia, XC 1/2)

I am thinking FF15, Tales of Berseria, Zesteria, Ys 9, and DQ11 are good places to start for the system. Maybe Nier. The Trails games were too slow and too dialogue-heavy for me (I beat one and played one other PSP Trails game).  I am still in wait-and-see mode for FF7R.  I wish I could play FF13 (12 was the last FF I played) but it seems that it will always be just PS3 and eternal sonata just ps3/xbox).

Any other games similar to what I want to get or just Jrpgs?  Honestly, Dark Souls/ Elden ring doesn't appeal to me, I think my personality type would get too frustrated with those games, I don't have the time or patience I think.

I loved the new worlds and the Uncharted-like exploration, Metroidvania elements, even the Sekiro-like combat was fairly satisfying. (Not as good as Sekiro, but more than serviceable.) I was close to the end of the game, but decided to take a long break. 

Tonight I decided to finish, and boy the climax and end of this game did not disappoint. That final area was great, and the final boss. &gt;!Then Darth Vader showing up and being a terrifying badass.!&lt; Oh man. This game desperately deserves a sequel. This game is by no means perfect, but it definitely deserves praise. The fact that EA of all people put this game forward is amazing. Respawn made a hell of a game."

I asked an employee and he said it was on the check where there were the instructions.
So i'm wondering why did sony as it just seems harder,i mean you anyway had to buy it in order to get the transparent box opened by the cash reguster guy and also most people just throw the check and probably lose the expensive ps plus.

So do you think they will change it and why did they really change it into the first place?"

 So I got another ps4 and everything was good for a while until the ps4 couldn't open again, but this time I initialized it and worked for 2-3 weeks until I couldn't open some games and the next day I couldn't open any game so I initialized it again and it worked, but after 2 days the problems came back with new problems, and everytime I open the ps4 it tells me that the ps4 cannot open and that I have to reinstall the system software but I press cancel and it worked everytime, but today it didn't work and here am I initializing it again, everything is going great till now but I know the problems will come back."

0,"Got shitfaced and pulled apart my ps4 So after a long day, and a few more beers than necessary, I thought it would be a good idea to pull apart my PS4. I have a launch issue one that was one of the first large purchases I ever made with my own money. I bought it in high-school, and she's still with me today.

Last few months I noticed she sounded like an asthmatic bull whenever I played a more graphically demanding game. Quite frankly, it scared me. I thought she was on her way out. 

Last night, she finally shit out on me as I was coming around the last lap of Monaco in F12021. I had staged a herculean comeback from p15, both max and bottas crashed out, and i was set to take the lead in the constructors. I'm fuckin pissed, and a few buds deep, so i fire my controller at the console as any reasonable human being would do.

So I stand up and spike my ps4 with my controller, which breaks off the glossy part of the system exposing the whole hard drive area (never knew you could remove that so easily). Wherein, I see what must be pounds of dust. All of a sudden, my mind flashes back to my childhood days when me and my dad would take apart our Playstation and clean out the vents when the system would get ""fuckey"".

Realizing this just became a much larger job, I go for the whiskey and set to it. So about three doubles, three stripped security screws, and countless frustrated expletives screamed drunkenly at youtuber MODDED HARDWARE I mange to take apart, clean out, and put back together my beloved childhood friend.

And guess what? She runs like a dream! Silent as a physically disciplined child. 

Moral of the story? When something fucks with you, get drunk and throw shit at it. Learned that from Sesame Street."

&gt;It allows you to invite a visitor to view your screen for up to 60 minutes a session. Share Play allows you to hand over your controller to a visitor so they can play instead. You can also invite your visitor to play a local multiplayer session over the internet, even if the game doesn't support online multiplayer. The visitor doesn't need to own the game to use Share Play.

I have a friend who's really bad at video games but likes them anyway. If you give him any sort of FPS game, he's what I call a walk-then-look player; he can't really operate both analog sticks at the same time. 

So despite that, he still just wants to hang out with me and another of our friends who I play with regularly, so I'll share my screen with him while our other friend and I play CoD or The Forest or something and he can be included. Or one time he shared his screen with me and I helped him out with Little Nightmares.

I haven't tried out the other two features of Share Play yet but I'm real curious.

Anyway, i know I'm very late to the party but I just think this is a wildly cool feature and if anyone else didn't know about it, well, now you do!"

0,"""Hold L3 to sprint"" needs to be done away with - for ALL games I'm playing through HFW right now - and loving it - but I'm experiencing the same quality of life problem I did when I played HZD, Nier: Automota, and every other fast-paced action game (3rd person, FPS, doesn't matter) and that is A REALLY SORE THUMB.

Sometimes battles go on for 10 or 15mins+ and during or by the end of them my thumb gets so damn sore from having to constantly press down on the left joystick while also frantically moving in all directions. 

Why can't sprinting simply be incorporated into ""full"" analog control? Is there a design or tech reason I'm not aware of? Is there a button mapping setting I missed? Or has this been standard for so long we just haven't questioned it?"

0,"What are some good ways to prevent stick drift? I'll be honest, i'm mostly an Xbox player as that's what I was introduced to at a young age and I just stuck with it. I only bring this up because naturally i'll notice some controller differences and one that I often find an issue with on PS is stick drift. I'm not overly aggresive when playing games, nor do I feel like I play PS enough for the sticks to wear out as quick as they do. I've been through 3 or 4 controllers in like a year and a half, I even have the knowledge to open them up and clean inside of those green squares (not knowledgeable enough to know what they are called lmao) next to the sticks themselves and while that helps for maybe a few days, it always comes back. What do you guys do to prevent this if you also suffer from it?"
0,"I thought my PS4 account was gone forever! I woke up this morning to discover that my account was hacked, someone spent hundreds of dollars and then changed the email. It was sooo stressful, but luckily it was resolved (not a lot of thanks to the horrible roundabout recovery method of PS).

So you have to make a new account just to fill out the information that the help bot needs. 

Once you're connected to a person, you'll give them the email and online id that was associated with the account. They also wanted the last four of the credit card I used on the account.

THIS IS KEY: I needed the pin number from the console that I originally created the account on. This means if you do not have the original console or said pin number, you're pretty much screwed. 

Whoever stole my account has nothing muhaha! They purchased Call of Duty and Elden Ring (among others), so I hope those bastards feel the hurt of lost progress!"

It's a 3D action adventure game with lots of puzzles with blocks, balls, fans, switches on the floor, etc. It's kind of like Talos Principle x Assassin's Creed or something. To do these puzzles you often have to teleport into a separate level. Sometimes you make your way around the platformed level/map, only to realize there's a ball/block way back at the start of the level that you needed to transport with you the whole way.

It's a sweet game, I highly recommend it."

0,"Injustice 2 bucks party Hey playstation fam,

I have my friends bucks party this weekend and was hoping for a hand from some of you. 

We usually play injustice together, so much so that we now will throw out a theme when playing against each other that dictates the characters you can choose from.

This will be simple, like ""wears a mask"", to more knowledgable themes like ""is part of another superhero group than the JLA."" nothing is too simple or too nerdy.

If you can just throw a few themes at me that you can think of I'm going to make a big list and we will draw them out as we play to celebrate his wedding!

Thanks in advance you legends!"

A couple days ago I decided to download it and try playing with randoms and to my surprise I'm enjoying it. I love the sense of discovery it gives as your exploring these alien worlds, and the game is designed in such a way that you always feel like you're able to contribute to your fellow players.

I'm not sure I'd recommend buying it but if you already claimed it, it might be worth checking out."

So I remember the days of 2000-2006, I was playing many PC games, including the most complicated than I have known at that time.

Even (most...) complicated games were very different from the current ones at the PS store, and it usually comes down to 2 basic differences:

1. It was user-friendly. Even RPG games that I have played were not overwhelming to the point where you just give up. You had a skill tree and items and the game knew that if the environment, the story, and the interactions were creative enough - it is going to be a good game.  
Now I find myself with almost no games to play.  
The only games I was able to at least finish were: Wolfenstein, Doom, Days gone  
Those games are not my cup of tea, and ""Days gone"" didn't even try to be an outstanding game - but at least I knew what to do.  
Now I play The Division 2 and I am so lost. I love the game, and I really don't mind if the games have further options and mechanics that I won't use and enjoy - as long as they are not interrupting my game experience.  
RPG games - you find yourself clueless and overwhelmed and the thing is, now many games that are not labeled as ""RPG"" also become so complicated.  
From the gear system of the new division to the burden of having to clean your gun every minute in RD2.
2. The games of this new era give you extra stuff (basically cheat codes) for money.  
I have no problem with that until I understand that if I want to play a fair and normal game online - I will just have to be satisfied with MK11.

Am I wrong here? Did I miss something?

I just want to enjoy standard games, preferably the kind that does have some creative options and features - are they still out there?

I want to play normal multiplayer shooting games, lest say 2 vs 2 like we used to play in the golden days of ""Quake"", without landing in a messy field of 100 players, knowing that some of them bought their gear with actual money.

Is there still room for people like me in the community? :O"

0,"Which PlayStation Plus Subscription will u be getting? When the subscription launches in June, it will be available as three separate tiers: PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Plus Extra, and PlayStation Plus Premium. The Premium subscription will feature up to 700-plus games.

The standard PS Plus subscription will be rebranded to **PlayStation Plus Essential**. Despite the new name, it's functionally the same services. PS Plus Essential will cost $60 per year and feature the same perks, including free games each month, cloud storage, online multiplayer, and discounts during select sales.

**PlayStation Plus Extra** will cost $15 per month or $100 per year and features up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games. Sony's description of the Extra tier is a bit vague, but subscribers will be able to download the games in the library to their console to play.

It'll include both first-party and third-party games. Considering the number of games in this tier, it sounds pretty much like a combination of PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, which will be discontinued in June. Current PlayStation Now subscribers will be converted to PS Plus Extra subscribers at launch.

The most expensive of the bunch, **PlayStation Plus Premium**, will feature ""up to 340 additional games"" versus the Extra tier. PlayStation Plus Premium will cost $18 per month or $120 per year. The Premium tier's additional games appear to largely focus on the PlayStation back catalog, with original PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PSP games available to play. PS3 games will be locked to cloud streaming, but at least some of the other backwards compatible classics will be downloadable.

The Premium tier comes with a couple other perks, including limited-time game trials and cloud streaming on PC. All three subscription tiers will be available on PS5 and PS4, though PS5 users will get access to more games.

I think i need some time to think on this."

0,"Venting about PS Store Purchase I have to vent to someone about this because... you may understand. I'll try to keep it brief:
*Purchased the $14.99 Monster Trucks add-on for Hot Wheels Unleashed. Yes, I think this is a rip off, however, my son LOVES monster trucks and we play video games to bond. I used the PS app to purchase it because I was at work and my wife was working from home with my son. 
*I checked out like I have dozens of times in the past. Got a confirmation email for my order. Got a notification my CC was charged. 
*Tried to initiate a download of content to PS4 at home but I didn't see the option. Facetimed with wife to walk her through how to check and download purchased add-ons on the ps4. The add on showed the price still and not purchased. 
*Walked my wife through the process to restore content licenses. It didn't work. 
*Called PS support. After 20 minutes I had to go b/c they couldn't figure out what was going on and I was at work... so I had to work. 
*Fast forward to 6pm. I called PS support again. After 31 minutes, I was told they see the game as purchased on their end, but they don't know why I cannot download it. They told me my only recourse was to contact the publisher directly to work it out. 
*When I asked for the game publishers information (Milestone), I was told to google it. I googled it. The only contact phone number listed is IN ITALY. 
*Reached out to PS store through chat bot. After about 8 minutes, I was told ""they'd make a one time exception"" and refund me, even though the content had been downloaded/used. It had not, hence my multiple attempts to resolve the issue.

Anyway, I probably wasted a very stressful hour dealing with this today, all for PS to treat it like it was my fault. I've been a PS user and account holder for as long as I can remember. I've never had an issue like this."

I thnk sony bricks 

consoles for forcing customers to buy a Ps5, its clear that the company doesn't  care about customers

Friends in Xbox say they've got a native LFG function, so its pretty easy for them to find and link up with new players. Most of the time I'm hitting up friends on Apex to come try it, and half like it amd half either hate it and never try it, because everyone loves their own comfort zone haha.

So, just curious what good LFG ps4 resources anyone knows about. 

I've tried a few apps, but they all feel like a dating site with profiles and crap except for Gamerlink, which is what I want and like, but its a tad outdated and needs new games like Splitgate added"

0,"Games like COD MW2 for Casual Gamers I'm a very casual gamer - I have two young kids so I play a few hours here and there a month. I don't play online, just single player story mode.

However, most modern games are very deep and complicated with all the crafting, upgrading weapons and character, editing loadout, earning new abilities, etc.

COD MW2 is ideal - you just turn it on and play and the controls are simple and intuitive enough to get quickly reacquainted when you haven't played in a while.

I've tried some of the more recent COD games like Black Ops but they're way too complicated and deep for me.

Any recommendations for FPS for a busy dad?"

0,"God of War Digital Deluxe Edition, $17.99 Ok first, I don't use reddit and I'm not sure how any of it works or if this will get a response? But I just wanted to ask if it's worth getting the game in title (God of War Digital Deluxe Edition). It's on sale (Spring Sale until 4/28) in the Play Station Store for about 18 bucks. I've done a little research and people say the digital deluxe for GoW (2018) is not worth. But rn, it's cheaper than the standard edition ($19.99).

Should I just buy the digital deluxe now, or wait until the standard edition goes on sale for potentially cheaper than $18? Thanks in advance for any replies."
0,"Um cl√°ssico, Need for Speed MW  "
0,"Where is this supposedly impossible game that people keep complaining about? Forbidden West first impressions and theory why so many people find it so damn hard For reference: beat Horizon Zero Dawn twice on the difficulty below Ultra Hard. Beat DLC on the same difficulty once. Got the Plat trophy, but not all DLC trophies (yet).

Where I am at the game: \[Spoiler\] I just did the futuristic human boss battle. I find it out to be a fun sequence all around and despite the new characters suffering from ridiculous SCI-fi clothing syndrome, I believe the story can be quite great if they develop them right. DO NOT SPOIL ME OR I WILL KILL YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY \[Spoiler\].

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting the game I read some forums (doing my best to avoid spoilers, and since I am pretty much a black belt in that art I managed to do so) and one of the main complaints/critiques is that the game is too hard. **I am playing on Very Hard** doing side quests and upgrading my equipment (without going out of my way to upgrade them to tier 3) and so far I can't find the major differences. Once you upgrade the Spear it can do a lot of damage to small/mid machines, the containers seem to be easily triggered, parts fall off after one or two hits... seem to be about the same difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

""The issue is playing the game just as you played Zero Dawn, you won't succeed that way in this game"". I mean, so far I've been playing like exactly the same. Start off with a sneak attack, kill small machines with Silent Strikes, hit canisters for elemental explosions, shoot off weak spots for damage. The only thing I find myself doing differently is using the Spike for general damage against some more troublesome units and using more traps. The latter feels great though? Can't see how it could be considered a downside. So far I haven't missed the long roll, and yeah, I didn't exactly engaged against big machines because I need to be stronger, although I did went madlad mode and engaged a Thunderjaw by a Bandit Camp with a Deathbringer gun (from a carcass, so no spoilers here, they might not be in the game, I don't know) and after doing some pitiful damage and angering the big fella I managed to dodge his ramming attack and ran away like a bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

Machines so far seem to be slightly more aggressive, but nothing like I expected to by reading some complaints. After some attacks they slow down or outright stop for a bit. Alloy gets up slower but I never got stunlocked and I think by now I played like 13 hours and never ran from a comba, and had my share of combats against multiple enemies. Maybe it's something they fixed? Only difference I noticed is that even some small/mid enemies attacks hit like trucks, but they are always the easiest to dodge (and that might be a Very Hard thing, not sure). Oh, and I'm not even using Surges right now.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory to the complaints regarding difficulty is that a lot of players beat the first game and DLC on normal and maybe even got the Plat that way, and thought to themselves ""yeah, time to get my gamer badge and beat this on Hard, I got this, I beat the whole game before"" and did so only to find out that the game on hard (or very hard) is, well, hard. If they played the first on Hard they would probably have trouble finishing it. I think playing on normal might instill some bad habits IF you are trying to play on high difficulties, like only relying on spear and bow damage and spamming rolls. **On higher difficulties, even on the original game,** you needed to use elements, canisters, traps, the Ropecaster and enemy weapons (like Disc Launcher) effectively to win.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, if you are not having fun just turn down the difficulty, no one cares, just have fun. I played games on Normal all my life until I hit like 22 (and that's playing games since like 7), and I still want to revisit Bioshock on normal because on hard the early game was a death simulator lol. In regards to other complaints, I think 95% of them are completely... weird? But that is a post for another day. So far I am having an absolute motherfucking blast with this game, and I honestly don't see that changing at all."

After playing the same the PS3 version. It was amazing. Didn't care about the funny voice acting and dialog it was fun running around the map fighting things.

Ghost of Tsushima 2018 E3 trailer: Wow did that impress me. The trailer was beautiful. Playing the game blew me expections even if the game doesn't look as good on my PS slim. Also I was like oh crap it's that old lady when I started her missions

Honorable mention: Final Fantasy 15 E3 trailer. Amazing trailer but didn't play the game even though I have it.  Also heard none of that was in the final game."

0,"if you are wondering what tv you should buy for playstation, wonder no more. Don't buy tv, buy a projector.

I did it, and its awesome.

Pros
- on my current setting i have a ~100 inch screen
- its 60 fps with 13ms lag (or something around that)
- you CAN play during the day, just close curtains
- even though mine is full HD its still good - its diffrent on projectors, full HD on 100 inch screen looks bad, here even on 300 inch screen (max) its still good. 
- during night its amazing experience. Both gaming and watching movies. I played pacific rim as i wanted to test it, and its like watching the movie first time again. 

Cons
- you need a white wall big enough for it
- during day you need to close curtains on your windows
- even then colors could be better (not great but also not too bad not to play)
- you need external speakers
- if you wanna true 4k then its very expensive 

Myths
- its quiet, can't hear it during gaming (ps4 is a looooot louder)
- if its not china you can comfortably play during day


Just my take on it"

0,"I think it‚Äôs time to say goodbye :( I just can‚Äôt enjoy playing my PS4 anymore. It‚Äôs too loud for me. I‚Äôve taken it apart and cleaned it so many times, hoping that maybe that might make it quieter. Unfortunately, I feel like that‚Äôs only made it louder and slower. After 4 years though I‚Äôm also feeling let down and deeply saddened that my Pro couldn‚Äôt last. At least I got to somewhat enjoy the games I played; but now I think I‚Äôm gonna have to just scrap it because I‚Äôm out of options.

It feels like a waste of time and money at this point, and I‚Äôm getting mad about it. Like my gf‚Äôs slim is quieter than my pro and is older than it. What did I do wrong to my machine to make it become so useless and obsolete? I don‚Äôt think GameStop can take it because of how loud it is. It‚Äôs in really good condition, but I just think the fan is too loud and they won‚Äôt be able to take it.

Anyways. Thanks for reading if you did, have a good day and be thankful of your Consoles working when they do."

0,"I'm actually glad that trophies aren't meant to be accessible. I mean come on. We have tons of accesibility features for games like letting people enjoy stories without gameplay holding them back and many more. I'm all for making the gaming experience as accessible and available for all kinds of people but messing with trophies aren't the way to go.

Trophies are meant for the so called ""elite"" people who want to explore and experience every piece of a game. Skill based trophies to exploration trophies, they are there to reward players who go out of their way to truly enjoy these games. Revealing hidden trophies or making all of them easily obtainable for the casual player just ruins the whole system in my opinion.

If you're someone who collects trophies or anything like that, you can always look up hidden trophies from the internet since you're not trying to figure it out trophies yourself in the first place anyways. Plus, certain trophies being hard to obtain is specifically why they're rewarding. I'm somewhere between a sweaty gamer to average player so I'm happy when I get a rare trophy or anything knowing my passion for the game was rewarded.

I just don't see why trophies should be accessible."

2. Similar to the last situation this one was even more weird it happened to my friend J and his friend B . So B owned the forest and he put his account as primary on J playstation and activated it as primary but then it put the forest into J purchased library of games I know it's
not just a visual glitch because ians Account is activated as primary on my playstation and I was able to download the and play the forest.

(Sidenote I'm not complaining at all I just thought this was a cool bug that we came across my friends was able to share his game to my account and I end
up being able to own the game) anyone have any thoughts on this or similar situations?"

According to a new report, [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://comicbook.com/category/warner-bros-discovery/) is aware that [DC Entertainment](https://comicbook.com/category/dc-entertainment/) is not utilized enough in the gaming space. Over the last decade, the only AAA DC games that have been released are the [Batman](https://comicbook.com/category/batman/): Arkham games, two Injustice games, some LEGO titles, and the Telltale Batman series. Largely, these all revolve around Batman for the most part and it highlights a growing issue with DC's representation in one of the biggest mediums in entertainment. This year, [DC will release *Gotham Knights*](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/gotham-knights-release-date/), a game featuring the Batfamily, and [next year, it will release *Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League*](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay/). It was also recently revealed that a Wonder Woman game is in the works, but it's still likely years away from release.

In a [new report from Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/dc-warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-hbo-max-1235232185/) which claims [Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to overhaul DC Entertainment](https://comicbook.com/dc/news/dc-entertainment-overhaul-warner-bros-discovery/), it was revealed that the company believes it needs to do more to grow the comic book brand. Although DC has a routine presence on the big screen, the report notes that the company is looking into bolstering DC's gaming efforts. As of right now, there's no indicator as to what that could look like, but it shows that the company is aware it can certainly do better. Many have been asking for games based on [Superman](https://comicbook.com/category/superman-comic/), The Flash, the Justice League, and many other key heroes, but nothing has come of it. [Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly believes that Superman needs to be revitalized](https://comicbook.com/dc/news/superman-warner-bros-discovery-reportedly-believes-needs-to-be-revitalized/) after a mixed reception to the character's recent on-screen appearances and then being abandoned.

Perhaps this will lead to Superman being represented in games soon as an effort to revive the character as a larger pop culture icon. Batman has dominated gaming for quite some time, but it's time for DC to expand these efforts with its plethora of rich characters. Of course, this will take a lot of time, but hopefully, it will pay off."
0,"PS4 Touchpad not working in The Last of Us So for some reason I cannot use the touchpad of my Dualshock 4 (PS4 controller) when playing The Last of Us.
It works perfectly fine in every other game that utilized it, but not that one specific game. Without crafting there's no way for me to do anything. (I'm not good enough to beat the game without making Medic Kits and Shivs)
It worked at first, but one day out of the blue it just stopped working. (Again, ONLY for that one game, so it's not a hardware problem)
My guess it's a The Last of Us update problem (so maybe others have the same issue), but not sure since nothing of it is online.

I found a reddit with a similar issue, but without an answer. Besides that ONE Reddit, I cannot find anything on the matter.

Anyone got anything? Any suggestion works to give a try."

At parties when I hang out with friends, the popping noise happens every second, and not able to enjoy spending time with friends without being annoyed.

0,"How can Sony get away with such a horrible return policy in 2022? I'm a casual gamer these days, felt like playing something new. After a bit of searching, I landed on Ghost of Tsushima. Looks like a fun single player experience, just what I'm looking for. So I open up the PS Store, search for it and see [two versions: Legends and Director's Cut](https://i.imgur.com/lwZ7OL7.png). Seeing how these are the only two versions available, I assume that Legends is the base version, while Director's Cut is all the extra bells and whistles I wouldn't want anyway. (One thing I truly despise about modern gaming is all the different versions, add-ons, season passes, DLCs, but I digress.)

Thus, I proceed and purchase Legends, only to find out after playing it for about 15 minutes that I've been duped, and it's a multiplayer co-op add-on I would never play in a million years. The single player campaign that I wanted? Oh, you gotta buy the Director's Cut edition for that. You know, the one that sounds like it's chock full of extra useless fluff, but it's really the only way to play the base game? Yeah, that. 

So no problem, right, I'll just contact support for a refund. I even said that I'd accept a gift card, they don't need to send my money back. Well, they just told me to go pound sand because I ""started downloading it."" 

I realize I could have been more thorough in my research before purchase, but, given the circumstances I just described, I think it's a fairly easy mistake to make by any consumer that's not a hardcore gamer. The vague description on the PS Store surely didn't help, there was nothing under Legends that would indicate that it lacked the single player campaign.

I'm puzzled how Sony can get away with such an anti-consumer, inflexible return policy in 2022."

David Haddad remains WB Games head amid WB-Discovery leadership shuffleIts remain unknown which of the game studios will remain under Warner Bros. Games or AT&amp;T

WB Games head David Haddad will keep his role despite a significant shakeup in the leadership ranks as parent company WarnerMedia merges with Discovery.

[As per the Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-executives-named-1235112576/), Discovery CEO David Zaslav yesterday announced new leadership appointments for the newly joined companies, with Haddad keeping his post.

He will report to JB Perrett, the newly appointed lead of the company's streaming and gaming business operations.

Haddad originally joined the company in 2013 and [was appointed](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-01-08-david-haddad-appointed-head-of-warner-bros-gaming) as head of the Warner Bros. gaming division back in 2015.

[The WarnerMedia division joined Discovery](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-05-17-warnermedia-merging-with-discovery-in-usd43bn-deal) after parting with AT&amp;T in a $43 billion deal last year. It was reported that the purchase would include some parts of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment but not all of it.

WB Games lists 11 offices worldwide, including Netherrealm Studios, Monolith Productions, TT Games, Rocksteady Studios, and Avalanche Software.

The merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery is expected to [close as early as today](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/discovery-warnermedia-merger-friday-close-1235225258/)."

0,"PSN needs to fix their report system. Seriously, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm in a group chat with a lot of friends I made on games and two of them got their accounts permanently banned. There was no toxicity, we‚Äôre just cussing and talking to each other like friends, joking around. Not sure if someone in the chat reported us or if they were somehow automatically picked up by a bot, but it‚Äôs ridiculous. I have a theory it was someone in the chat since there was a previously toxic dude in the chat who was being an asshole and we removed him, and I believe someone else in the group chat was friends with him, so he may have purposely reported our messages as revenge. It would make sense because that toxic guy is known for getting people suspended by reporting them constantly. It‚Äôs ridiculous how we can get banned just for cussing jokingly with friends, I‚Äôm sick of how much this report system is being abused.

0,MGS V TPP why I like the helicopter loading screen. I've heard a lot of people complain about the long unskippable helicopter loading scene before each mission. I really like this part of the game because it's extremely realistic. I was a white water raft guide and active duty army (did not see combat or fly in any helicopters) but the reason why I like this loading screen is because it gives you the very realistic feeling of the emotional roller coaster of doing scary things that have a long and boring drive to get to. It's really common to have a very calm and mellow ride in a vehicle when you just stare out at the world on your way to go do something really intense and scary or to have that scenic ride back after a crazy event when you get to meditate and reflect on either what you're about to go do or what you just did. The really mellow and relaxing ride gives a great contrast to the intense moments in the game that helps make them seem more substantial because of the contrast. In a world of games with instant respawn a non-stop action the realisticness of the emotional roller coaster of actually doing intense things is is often lost. It's all the little things like this in all the metal gear solid games that really help make them an experience and more than just another game.

Where do you guys put 2 in the overall rankings of open world games? I just feel like it was so fun, care free and I love the vibrancy of SF. Sure it may look a little too bright but I just love that about it.

The NPC‚Äôs are pretty funny and entertaining as well.

0,"fasely suspended for a month. i got suspended for 4 weeks due to ""violations of the community guidelines"", which is really annoying, and after reading the whole guidelines, i couldnt find any reason for me to get banned, execpt me and my friends jokingly insulting eachother, and i didnt even feel like i went too far, but none of us reported eachother, and none of my friends got suspended, not even my friend that already got suspended like 10 times, exept me?

this is extremely bad for me as i feel like absolute shit without playing with my friends, and i have no other way to play with them.

is there any way i can contact playstation support (rather not call, but thats also an option i guess) to ask them to unsuspend me, or atleast tell me the reason???"

By the time the patch copies my spare time is up so I rarely actually get to play anything. How has anyone handled the PlayStation 4? Its almost useless."

The game was fine at first , managed to play it for a couple of days , maybe like 4-5 days and then the progress issue popped up -talked to Playstation support and they gave me my refund


With that money I was given back I bought another game and I havent played it for more than 30 minutes and noticed the absolutely horrible frame drops which made the game unplayable/unenjoyable and it really broke my heart since o really wanted to play it

But when I requested the refund they told me that since I opened the game and played it I camt get the refund... of a game I haven't played for more than 30 minutes...

Yet I got a refund for a game I tried for several days... 

I'm not upset about it , I guess I'll just have to live with it but I'm just disappointed with the consistency of PS Support

I dont know if i knocked loose something nasty hidden inside the stick or what or if it'll last a week but i thought i would share in case anyone else is about to toss their controllers."

you at least need a device that has a jack or Bluetooth for ur audio and fast, FAST wifi

you need a 2nd acc for your PS4 and PS Remote Play device logged in and set as primary acc so you can connect it and by that ur done just log in ur main account NORMALLY and play"

0,"PS Plus vs Xbox Gamepass After much research, I have found out what PlayStation would have to do to make 'PS Plus' better than 'xBox Gamepass'. 

Tiers --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Firstly, they would have to remove the 'Extra Tier'. This would give the 'Essential Tier' more benefits.
Benefits --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Essential - access to PS4 and PS3 games (all games are downloadable)
‚Ä¢ Premium - access to PS2, PS1 and PSP games (all games are downloadable)
Additional Perks --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Monthly downloadable games
‚Ä¢ Cloud gaming (for mobile and PC)
‚Ä¢ Free games 
‚Ä¢ EA Play
‚Ä¢ Online multiplayer
Cloud Saves --&gt; Does not require a subscription
More Perks --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Play games on PS Plus the same day they release
‚Ä¢ Early access to games on Premium Tier
‚Ä¢ Free in-game content
Prices --&gt; Price Per Month:
‚Ä¢ $9.99 (Essential)
‚Ä¢ $14.99 (Premium) 

Price Per Year: 
$59.99 (Essential)
$99.99 (Premium) 

Family Plan: 
$79.99 Annually (Essential)
$119.99 Annually (Premium) 

If PlayStation managed to make all these changes to their service by June, it could become better than the xBox Gamepass, or at least the same."

The custom difficulty lets you choose what specifically you want to be super easy or super hard. Damage done to alloy can be raised or lowered along with enemy health loot drop rates etc. 

Maybe I think the damage I deal is fine but I'm getting one shotted. I can adjust as I see fit. 

I like that it's not a one size fits all super easy or super hard but there's a lot of nuance in between. The easy loot especially is pretty superb for grinding.

However, I'm by no means a video game expert.  I just feel that after waiting, so long to play it, and reading posts about how great it was. I feel disappointed and very underwhelmed."
0,"What kind of scam is Sony trying to get away with here? I fully own ps plus yet my PS4 keeps trying to trick me into re-buying it at full price I fully own ps plus and just bought a 12 month pass of it last August yet my PS4 is trying to tell me that I need to re-buy it just to play any of my purchased games. Like this is such a scummy thing to do. I should still have at least another 4 months left of it yet it‚Äôs saying that I have none and that I need to buy more like wtf. 

Is there any way to avoid this blatant scam or am I forced to just play free to play titles till someone files a lawsuit against them over this?

And yes I it was for sure last August that I bought exactly 12 months so there‚Äôs no way I could have run out of ps plus"

And if one of them do load up a game they don't really care about the game they just talk and drive around in gta or something

Also I see Instagram reels of people posting of how gaming used to be where they actually played the game then it goes onto the part where they are just talking and not even concentrating on the game and I was quite surprised other people do it as well. 

So do you lot just jump on just to talk"

Welcome to NODE Gamers‚Äô massive list of over 1500+ games; these games are all part of PlayStation+ (Essential, Extra and Premium), PlayStation‚Äôs new tiered subscription service.

This list is tailored towards trophy hunters, looking for the quickest platinum‚Äôs, or just quick games for trophies that you can work your way through. We will also include a hyperlink to the end for those of you who want longer games, or games most likely to contain Ultra Rare trophies.

The games included in PlayStation+ are already quite familiar. Tier 1 includes the PS Plus we already know, tier 2 includes PSNow‚Äôs PS4 range and will now include PS5 games, Tier 3 will include PSNow‚Äôs PS3 range. There are other benefits but we are solely focusing on games with trophy support."
0,"Spartacus isn't a good idea. Its a good idea if you just want to have the basic ps plus version and don't care about the ps now aspect. Its good if you want the ps plus and ps now both at the same time. But it's not good if you want ps now without psplus Sometimes I just want ps plus without ps now. Sometimes I just want ps now without ps plus. 
What if I start out thinking oh I just want ps plus, so I buy a year of the base plan, and then 2 months in I decide, hey I actually want to play ps now for a month. In the old separate way I could just spend ten dollars and have ps now for a month. Now what's going to happen? I already bought a year of the base plan (just ps plus) now I want to add ps now, so I have to pay for more ps plus just to play ps now ? How would it even work, would it override the current ps plus only month and then wedge in the ps plus and ps now , and then when that month is over revert back to the old ps plus only subscription?
They should remain separate it gives the consumer more flexibility."

I turn it on and it boots up fine but will not connect to my wifi booster. I have fought this for over a week with no results. I‚Äôve tried every thing I can find on the internet and YouTube. All my devices will connect to my extender but my PS4 will not. It will connect to my router that is one room away but not to the extender that is in the same room as my PS4.

0,"I think my ps4 is fucked I've had my ps4 for about 6 years now and it hasn't run into any major problems until now. About a year ago I was playing when suddenly the ps4 ejected the disc by itself. I shrug it off as just a weird thing that happened except it kept ejecting discs for no reason. So I watched a video which told me to take the rubber foot off the bottom, which I did. This solved the problem immediately and I thought that was that. However my ps4 also started experiencing another problem which was shutting down randomly. It would beep randomly, and then the ps4 just shut off completely as if someone pulled the plug. I know it isn't overheating because just yesterday I was literally on the home menu not even doing anything when it just shut off randomly. And to make it worse my ps4 is now randomly ejecting discs again. Again, I know it's not overheating because it just does it when I'm not even doing anything, and I clean my ps4 quite regularly sooooo yea.

0,"At 30 years old I have FINALLY embraced my love for video games. I think after years of going the digital route, the physical discs and cases have created this sorta nostalgic feeling to gaming for me. It rekindles this love that I‚Äôve always had as a kid but somewhere along my path of growing up it was suppressed by family and friends. I still played video games but felt weird about expressing how I felt about the story of certain games, their characters and the world created in them. Now for some reason at the age of 30 I have finally gotten over that (maybe subconscious I‚Äôm not sure) thought/feeling of, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt love video games that way and stop being lazy‚Äù feeling and have fully embraced my love for them.

I‚Äôve expressed this before to a few people and their reply was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably because of its now popularity of the gaming community.‚Äù Which of course that could definitely be it but maybe because of the now popularity, I now have this feeling like I‚Äôm part of a community and I‚Äôm not alone in my love for video games on a much bigger scale. I certainly didn‚Äôt have that feeling growing up but it‚Äôs nice to have it now as I play with random strangers and we strike up a friendship and express together the love we have over the same things. 

This was just a random thought that I had as I was typing this in a reply to another post/comment. So I felt like sharing this epiphany that just occurred with me. 

Thank you to everyone out there that has been kind enough to play some video games and have a chat with me."

I might be over-scrupulous here, but..

1. It‚Äôs plastic-ky and feels poorly built. I hate that there is not much of a heft to it. Doesn‚Äôt feel solid in the hands. Sony could have used some higher quality plastic along with rubber grips under-neath and for the sticks.

2. Buttons are mushy. I love how the Macbook trackpad clicks. The buttons could also be pressure sensitive (something like 3D Touch?)

3. R3 and L3 sticks can be made pressure sensitive or adaptive. Like when you are pulling a lever in Uncharted or GOW, the sticks can offer more resistance as you are completing the pull.

4. The touch pad can be put on the back of the controller so that it can accessed by the ring finger?

Coming to the title, I‚Äôm a huge Apple fanboy and I wonder what innovation could Apple bring to a game pad?

In the case we belive it in its entirety (both what each sub tier entails and what their prices are), I I'm fairly certain that the current PS+ subscription translates to the new Gold edition.

Please correct me if wrong, but if we compare prices, there is a difference of whole 15 fucking dollars per 3m(60$ for a year), which will be around the 50$ mark for the yearly subscription.

So currently the yearly sub is 59.99$ and the new (gold variant) will be imo 100$√∑120$. Does this mean that we will need to pay literally twice the amount for just keeping our benefits as they are now?? 

Its absolutely stunning for me, especially since the sub increased in price no more than 1-2y ago...."

0,"The PS4 is my first PlayStation. How I came to own it and what my first impressions are. **TL;DR** \- RemotePlay helped finally fit the PS4 into my life. Despite some baffling decisions or oversight, the graphical prowess and continued support for the platform is encouraging. If Sony could just do better with it's RemotePlay support, I would be ecstatic.

**Question:** What do you consider to be knockout features?  

\----------------------------------------------------

Being that I'm mostly on the go, I never seem to be able to find the time to actually be in one place long enough to game and make what I feel is significant progress - especially since I'm a fan of JRPGs or games that have RPG elements to them. It's why I've always leaned towards portables such as the 3DS, Vita and the Switch. 

**So why the PS4 now?**

Well, I've been a big fan of the Persona series. I've played Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden multiple times. I've also been able to distract myself when Persona 5 came out and also had some wishful thinking of it appearing on Switch. However, with Persona 5 Royal having been released and Persona 5 Strikers - the sequel to Persona 5 already out. It appears to me that the writing has been on the wall long enough to tell me that the mainline game won't be making an appearance. Especially since the previous entries never did.  

**But what about portability?** 

It didn't occur to me until a few weeks ago what Remote Play was really about, and that is the ability to play on a VITA, smartphone, or tablet on the go - so long as there is a WiFi/data connection. When that became apparent, the other shoe dropped. It was like a watershed moment. It was shortly after that a PS4 had found a new home. 

**What are your thoughts?**

It's been a week since I've owned the PS4. Here's some first impressions.

First the good stuff:

* I can't believe I didn't know about RemotePlay sooner! Being able to access the library on the go is a game-changer
* What a rich library of games! I feel like I'm in a fortunate position where there are so many quality games that have had enough time pass so that they can be bought at a fraction of the original price. In my eyes, that is a bargain. 
* I'm excited to experience the PS4's graphical prowess on the go. Beyond having it work on my phone and tablet, I've gotten it to work on the Chromecast too!
* I'm really happy to see that there are still new titles coming to the platform this year
* Being able to use this as a media center is pretty nifty - though I have yet to dive into it.
* The PSN Store UI is pretty nice

Room for Improvement

* The Settings menu needs a revamp somehow. Perhaps maybe it can learn through my usage of what settings I frequently toggle. (ex: connecting/disconnecting my controller since I use it on the go)
* Why no Bluetooth audio support?
* RemotePlay is amazing - when it works. I live in a major city and take a bus to work. There are several moments where there are just dropped connections. Is this a compression issue or something?
* Can Sony please come up with a compact controller on the go or some kind of more pocket-friendly peripheral? You can't necessarily slide the controller into your pants pocket."

Can't download the DLC on my Russian acc.

The title says it all. I pre-ordered Lost Judgment Ultimate Edition (On August) that gives me every Downloadable content.

Back to our present: The Kaito Files DLC is out. As the Ultimate edition owner, I can purchase the DLC for free. But here's the catch: I can't. It doesn't have a price tag and pressing the Download button gives me E-8210604A error. I tried to download the DLC through my alt accounts: Japanese, US, even Indian. They all have a price tag, unlike my Russian acc. I'm desperate as the fan, and frustrated as the person who spent $60 for the Ultimate Edition. Please help me."

0,"No signal found Hello, I‚Äôve been trying to play on my PS4 (first gen) and I bought 3 new hdmi cords and tried them all and when i turn on the PS4 it showed no signal found. I tried unplugging everything for a long time then replugging back in and nothing. Then I tried to do the safe mode method and plugged in my controller and everything and it still shows a black screen that says no signal on my tv. Tried opening it up and cleaning the hard drive and blowing on it etc and putting it back and still nothing seems to be working. Tried everything. Anyone else have a solution idk about besides taking it in to get fixed as that would be my most obvious and last resort."
0,"Will connecting fiber optic router to PS4 via ethernet cable improve speed? Hello, for the past few years i've been playing on PS4 through wifi and/or wifi extender/repeater and It was never great but doable, i've finally decided to buy a long ethernet cable (room far away from where the modem is) and start playing through it, and I'm mainly looking to play mmorpgs (mainly ESO) where ping plays a role in it, will playing through wired cable improve speed and ping?



and most of the places around me sell CAT 7 ethernet cable will that be okay or do i have to buy CAT 6 for best experience? thanks! [ ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oscars2022on/)

0,"Cannot connect my controller to system. So i own a ps4 pro wich was sitting around for a while.
In the meantime i used both of my ps4 controllers on the steamlink. So now i wanted to play some spiderman again and my controllers wouldn't connect to the system at all. First i tried charging them up via a seperate cable and the orange light was showing. Did not resolve the issue. The i tried to reset the controllers multiple times and that did not work either.
I started the steamlink and made sure they werent connected and tried again.
I tried both front usb ports on the system and the back ones.

So is my only option now to buy a new controller and relink the other ones via bluetooth again or is there some other solution to it?"

0,looking for a long PS4 USB charger I have had bad luck with controllers over the yrs I have 4-5 that have burnt out or just completely stopped working after a month or so of use (even brand new). I have a USB cord but is only about 2 feet long so I am unable to play and charge or charge efficiently can I buy any USB and charge it from my PS4 and not burn out my controller? Or is it best to buy a actual licensed PS4 USB? I have used regular USB cords with my controllers and charged through a extension cord but seem to burn the controller out at 1 point or another

Experience so far:
Completed Horizon ZD by myself and am working on the Frozen Wilds expansion at the moment.

0,"Cursed ps4 controller? (help?) Okay so here's a little context. I recently started getting some pretty serious stick drift on my one working controller so I went to the store to pick up a new one. I got home, opened it up, turned it on and plugged it in and it worked fine. The next day I tried turning on my controller and I got nothing, the light didnt go on, the reset button didnt work etc. it was dead dead. I didnt have the recipt bc I'm a dumbass and got rid of it asap so I counted it as a loss and went on with using the drifting controller for a few months, I had little ways of fixing it (turning it upside down and giving the sticks a wiggle, using a pin to clear out debris) and it was useable for the most part. Well yesterday I decided I was sick of the drift and decided to transfer over the battery from the drifty one to the new one in hopes that I could use it again. Long story short it worked, I turned it on, no drift no problems, basically a brand new controller. 5 mins later I took it home (fixed it at my parents bc they have the tools I need) and when I got home the controller didnt turn on. Again. I couldn't plug it in, I couldn't press the reset, nothing worked. Now I have no controllers that work and I'm very frustrated that my ps4 controller is frying all my batteries. I dont really know what to do other than go buy a new one and I was mostly just going on here to rant lmao but if any of yall have ideas please send them my way."

At the moment I don't really have a list of games I want to play so I was wondering why not get into HZD again before I get to play HFW. That way the story will be fresh in my mind.

However, a thing about open world games like HZD is that halfway through the game the gameplay becomes boring and exhausting. I don't want to finish HZD and then jump straight into HFW and experinece similar gameplay for another 60 or so hours.

So my question is, should I finish HZD again before leading up to HFW or skip HZD, read the synopsis of the original game, and go into HFW fresh?"

0,Felt like I was scammed. I‚Äôm not sure how to frame this or if it‚Äôs ever happened to anyone else. I got a notice on my PlayStation saying that I was permanently banned from the network for violating community rules. I couldn‚Äôt log on I was blocked. I found the error code and it regarded chargebacks and the reversal of charges for bundle purchases I‚Äôd made. I checked with my financial institution that I used and they said all the payments were processed for the purchases and weren‚Äôt charged back. I emailed PlayStation Network and explained this. They send a email basically reiterating that I charged back the purchases and gave me a balance I had to pay. I had to purchase PlayStation store credits from a store and enter the codes. I buy a card for more than the amount owed by $5.00. Later I received an email from them saying the card had insufficient funds to lift the ban and gives me another balance to pay that was $6.00 less than the original balance owed. Next time I buy a $50.00 card submit the code. After about 6 hours or so I received another email explaining the ban had been lifted. So after paying $75.00 on a $50.00 charge the ban was lifted but the strange part is I check my transactions made and only the bundle purchases and the $25.00 card store cash payment are shown in transactions and not the other $50.00 card I purchased. Nor was there any balance for overpayment. Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else on the PlayStation Network?

Nothing is wrong with the HDD and I'm convinced that the ps4 not being cleaned may be the issue but I don't know. 

Anybody got better suggestions for me? Please I need this."

Obviously the key to the game is pull the joystick back and forward in an exact manner. 

Once I was able to get over the morality of the issue, is there some 3D printer gizmo that I can put on my controller to ensure this happened perfectly?  Or even some type of guide like the dudes from the shooting game tape up their screen?  I'd like to pull off a magical round just because.  

Thanks!"

0,"Database Corruption Assistance After playing through a decent bit of Horizon Forbidden West the game began crashing which led me to trying other games to confirm it was or was not the game itself. Yep, Elden Ring joined the constant crash party.

Things got progressively worse and now I cannot actually get into the ps4 without a constant death loop of ""Database is corrupted, PS4 will restart.""

Went ahead and rebuilt the database a few times to no avail. Got desperate and initialized the ps4 as well, still the same end result.

I removed and put the harddrive back in to see if that would magically fix it. We knew it wouldn't!

Bought a 2 TB external harddrive. Now I am not the most tech-savvy so bear with me here. Can I just use that external harddrive and totally remove the internal to see if it resolves? Or does the ps4 need an internal?

If so, what do I need to do?

Or if anyone has any additional advice I'd be grateful."

At first i redownloaded my system software to remove all the corrupt files but that didnt end up helping much. Yesterday i finally decided that despite the almost 300 hundred funny or cool clips i had in multiple different games(would take to long to transfer) i would put my ps4 on factory modus. According to every YouTube video i watched this is the final option to get rid of corruption errors. Now with a supposedly new playstation i logged in to my account and downloaded just 1 game wich instantly closed again due to corruption error and shut down my whole playstation.

0,"Horizon Forbidden west vs Elden ring what both did so good personal opinion By mainly comparing the 5 key features of both of them that I have taken: 

## i)LORE:

Horizon Forbidden west is longer most probably if considering only the cutscenes and total events that occur in the main storyline whereas Elden ring¬† story is shorter a little if you don‚Äôt do anything extra and get the 2 great runes only do the main questline so the rating according to the story of both : **Horizon 9.2 Elden ring 9.1 and remember the 2 stories are of different categories** one is fantasy future world and one is fully new fantasy world and one uses technology improvements and new AI‚Äôs whereas the other is based on becoming the Elden Lord and runes and great runes and both containing some interesting twists and in ELDEN RING you can change the ending whereas it‚Äôs not possible in HFW but you can change alloy‚Äôs personality and choices and be bold ,smart or kind are hear about everyone‚Äôs views and stories .

## ii)Graphics:

Both are huge open world games but Elden ring‚Äôs map is bigger but Horizon FW‚Äôs map is pretty big too and contains the ruins of San Francisco and many more old world ruins and both have great graphics but HFW‚Äôs graphics is better and on an unrelated note Horizon‚Äôs is a more realistic approach so there is difference but Elden ring has very good graphics also considering the huge FANTASY DARK world so **HFW : 10 and Elden ring 9.6.**

### iii)Open world :

As far as the open world goes both games are super good with interesting side quests and extra features and both got interesting creatures considering the animals and monsters, demons, machines variety and both the worlds got various and interesting environments from twisters in the sand to sea and it‚Äôs beaches ,jungles, mountains and from scarlet rot lake to dragon ruins of caelid , dungeons and many many more so **RATINGS are Elden ring : 10(since it got everything from libraries turning upside down to a city underground and hidden and many many more)¬† and Horizon : 9.8** and horizon also got **huge sea world** as **you can swim everywhere and FLY** too .

### iv)Gameplay and combos :

Both have good gameplay and Elden ring got hack and slash and horizon FW got new combos finally but the ashes of war and spells and incantations make Elden ring gameplay too good as you can do many things from summoning your CLONE to using dragon incantations and HFW also got way more weapons and traps and you can ride a freaking Dino machine which breathes fire and has claws and you can fly and race too and you can be wolverine too in ELDEN RING so the following **RATING is : HFW 10 ELDEN RING 10**.

#### v)Side quests and NPC:

HFW has got many side quests and some are kind of continuations of first game‚Äôs side quest and there is interesting choices in these side quests and the side characters have personalities and ego for example when there is to decide who will be the clan leader of DESERT CLAN and you can choose and try to convince both of them. Elden ring has got good NPC designs and structure and got a imp side quest that affects the storyline and unlocks many more things and major characters have good personalities and¬† interesting connections but non major NPC‚Äôs are like normal NPC they give you a task or tell you to find something and you can bring it to them and some helps you in boss fights so the Rating is HFW 10 , Elden ring 9.

It's basically Nioh. A bit different. Sadly not as deep as Nioh's combat system, but it's still a ton of fun.

if you view this in the same league as an arcade brawler, pure gameplay and ignore the story, least until the second half, you will have a really good time. Purely from a combat standpoint, Team Ninja beats Fromsoft ten times over, and in battles I'm having more fun than in Elden Ring. From does everything else much better, but in combat Team Ninja can really teach From one or two lessons."

0,"The lack of coverage and censoring over Gran Turismo 7 having microtransactions, lootboxes and progression similar to a F2P gacha game but priced 70-80$ is extremely concerning. Hopefully  for a lot of people on reddit this isn't news, Gran Turismo 7 released  and then patched the game to favor Microtransactions (credits) by quite  litteraly halving credits gains in all modes.

On  top of that, the game has a ""lootbox"" system (tickets) that you can get  daily from grinding some modes. The gain in the game is so bad that it  would take weeks just to unlock ONE of the high-end cars, which is  beyond madness for a console AAA game (of course, this is all bypasses  with real life money).

The  ticket/lootbox system is also very misleading and introduced in a way  that makes casual players think odds are in their favor. The existence  of that system in the game gives the likely possibility that the devs  can easily introduce those tickets as a paid optional currency.

With  the backlash of Battlefront 2 and how severe it was, i'm surprised that  the media and Sony themselves are trying their hardest to censor any  talk about this, even tho i find Gran Turismo 7 to be MILES MORE SCUMMY  than Battlefront 2 ever was (mainly because of how this was introduced).

I  follow some youtube channels that usually cover these kind of cases and  surprisingly they haven't covered it. A lot of mainstream gaming media  platforms also haven't talked about it in the slightest. I am very  afraid of the consequences and impact on the industry if the consumers  let this slide and do not voice their opinion.

Do  you seriously believe a barebones game with unfinished content, fully  priced, has the right to push you to use more money on the product to  unlock things that should be fairly obtainable through varied gameplay?  It is not the case here, not by a long shot. Gran Turismo 7 is one of  the highest selling games of the year so far and Sony has been trying to  cover up the bait &amp; switch. For more information, just go on [r/granturismo](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/)  and filter top posts of the week. To sprinkle more salt over all this,  the game's producer quite litteraly told players the ""sense of pride and  accomplishment"" line."
0,"Any indie devs on here? Curious to know how your game has sold, how Sony has been with willing to market, etc. I see a lot of games pop up on the storefront that I just think to myself ""who in their right mind is going to buy this for $5 let alone 20"". Many games with weird settings nobody will ever really care about (such as sailors), trailers that show no gameplay (which is never a good sign), etc.

For those of you who did successfully launch, how was your experience? For those who succeeded or failed, would you do it again? I can't imagine much worse in life than spending years making a game only for it to sell like 100 copies. I'm not looking for failure stories to ""get off"" or anything stupid like that, just stuff like that seems interesting to hear about."

0,"PS4 Can Run All Games Upto 60fps Guys I wanted to ask why aren't Devs making 60fps on ps4. Before anyone says that ps4 is not strong enough, please let me tell you that how Jailbreak ps4 can run games upto 60fps by removing fps cap.

RDR2  (40-50fps) mostly on 1080p and on 900p better fps.
Bloodborne 
Uncharted 4

I mean even Battlefield games run upto 60fps on base ps4, with 1080p resolution. And looking at 
Dying Light 2, where it's 720p and not even 60fps. Worse!! It's not stable on 30fps either.

And if I am right, if developers just don't do it, than why aren't we talking about it. I mean HOGWARTS LEGACY is just around the corner and I want it to be 60fps on my console. We should atleast raise a voice about it."

I don't want to send it to get fixed because i still hope there might be a solution I could find which would fix my issue. 

I've tried everything, blowing inside with liquid oxigen, cd's are literally factory new, (i NEVER touch the bottom part) so no need to clean any, i restored the data, i even reinstalled the PlayStation software as indicated on the webpage, i tried the tapping technique, laying it on EVERY SINGLE side, i even tried to shake it a little while it was trying to read the cd, nothing. 
Nothing helped, does anybody know any other solution which might not involve disassembling the whole console? 

Facts that might be considered: for the last year or so, it's been standing vertically,
(i'm guessing that's why ""PLACING IT VERTICALLY"" doesn't solve my problem). I tried with all my physical games and it just won't read them."

I can‚Äôt help but wonder why I can‚Äôt find DualShock 4s yet surpluses of the new ps5 controllers seeing as there aren‚Äôt any ps5s in stock. Since when was there a shortage of ps4 controllers and why :/


Really sucks having to deal with stick drift every 2 months past- not having the means to fix it so having to buy new ones- only to find there aren‚Äôt any.. 

The store clerk said they‚Äôd not had any shipments of them since mid 2021.

Blows my mind that they‚Äôre in shortage seeing as there‚Äôs the new console and controller- what, did people give up the ps5 wait and get ps4s??

Hate to rant but I think some of Sonys products are just a waste of money. I‚Äôve paid around 400$ for the console, probably the same amount again for the many controllers that end up unusable after a couple months.. When I say unusable I mean it, it feels like playing with Tourette‚Äôs- your camera jerking and sliding everywhere with the slightest touch.

And no, it‚Äôs not a dead zone issue."

0,"Will I get banned for editing saves long time ago? Hello,

So I had been playing ""Dark souls remastered"" ""Persona 5"" and ""Nioh"" 4 years ago (2018). I used a save wizard (Cyber Save Editor) made from Japan to gain some fast experiences (souls, amrita, money). Although I don't remember did I went online mode after I had edited the stats (probably yes), I didn't play any multi-player feature at all such as co-op, invading. And it has already been 4 years since the last time I used that wizard. I have even change from PS4 to PS5 now.

Will I get banned after so many years? [ ](https://medicina.ufm.edu/wp-content/epo/videos-snr.6.html)

You almost never have a game where you work a normal job as a doctor,lawyer, engineer or teacher.

I think the closest real life job that emulates being in a video game would be either a career criminal (bad) or a
Special Forces soldier (good)."

as a follow-up of the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/oe3l7u/lg_20172021_oleds_calibrated_settings_for_xbox/) I would like to share my **2022 Update** for my **FINAL** set of professionally **Calibrated Settings for all LG 2017-2022 OLEDs and Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 / PC gaming**, with the best PQ and lowest Input-Lag results possible (from 6ms to 21ms based on model), **including Dolby Vision and webOS in-built Apps calibration also compatible for Movies and TV Shows**.


These are actual meter based calibration settings using a certified Spectracal C6 meter, Murideo 6G pattern generator, and CalMan for Biz + disc based + direct feedback with both games, tv shows and movies gathered in 5+ years of usage.


Yeah, I know, ""real calibration cannot be copy/pasted from TV to TV as they're all different"" , but tested LG OLED variance between models is much lower then average, and even within a 3% variance you will still experience a much more accurate image compared to default presets, plus CMS and WB advanced options weren't touched, so you're not risking of dialing in wrong values.


There are **6 Profiles** to independently 1-time-Calibrate for each source/content combination, and then forget about it.


In order to do it, just change the video source to the one you want to calibrate (for example: webOS Netflix app, or to HDMI1 connected to Xbox One|Series X / PS4 Pro or PS5) and then load up the type of video content you want to calibrate (for example: launch an SDR Game, or an HDR Game, or a Dolby Vision movie).


Once you're ready, apply those Suggested Presets (click Titles to open the documents, you can also print them for convenience):

 **FOR 2017 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:

 

* [**Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 + SDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHY0Y-5dzfkMj8Xl2XrnOgqSX6FFp04IDd5gv_F699Y/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just stay in the Dashboard Home. All Xbox SDR contents will share the calibration;


* [**Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 + HDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ArpZ_OOJP2K3oeogB7eou7NRPJlKLxpEc6kI5Yguk/edit) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: Try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open ""Insects"" Demo or any other HDR game. All Xbox HDR contents will share the calibration


* [**Xbox One/Series X|S + Dolby Vision Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D62pGcvPfOQN3mh_j11PYwh1thF-JPOu5cHlB9tVzdI/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*:  try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app and launch a DV movie. All Xbox One Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + SDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvUD2Tue-GyQJuCpW3pPAOTZ-YlHhqHKTjf4ri1Ngw4/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app from your LG remote. All webOS SDR contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + HDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Ov1kKmrA-Z_oyX5Gj4O-YzI_75tboxrKbRNoFOxYM/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open YouTube app from your LG remote, and search for any HDR videos. All webOS HDR contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + Dolby Vision Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKwavl6b5eHh9ylQFKBQLD08rhQNcDMEiWnM4J3x6hw/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example open Netflix app from your LG remote, and start playing ""Altered Carbon"" show. All webOS Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration.; 


*These settings are tailor made and compatible with ALL 2017 LG OLEDs variants (e.g. LG B7, C7, E7, G7, W7). For newer series' settings, read below.* .


 **FOR 2018 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:

Use the same settings for 2017 series above, then apply the following changes:

* **HDR Game** preset: set Color value back from 60 to 55; set Dynamic Contrast: OFF; set Dynamic Tone Mapping: ON;


* **Dolby Vision** preset: change OLED Light value from 50 to 100.





**FOR 2019 to 2022 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:


* Use ""PC"" HDMI Icon for your HDMI devices in order to unlock 4:4:4 Chroma Subsampling for both SDR and HDR (You can change the HDMI icon going into ""TV Home Dashboard"" and then ""All Inputs"" section);
* See/Print and Apply the following [**2019-2022 Overall Settings Chart**](https://i.imgur.com/2FiNBnT.png)


Also don't forget to **Calibrate ""system-wide HDR"" both for Xbox and Playstation** consoles by following these instructions:

* [**Xbox HDR Calibration app - HDR Optimized Settings**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/63781208)

* [**Playstation HDR Calibration app - HDR Optimized Settings**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/63780325)


Now you're ready to enjoy the best visual quality out of your LG OLED (2017 to 2022 series) and your gaming consoles. 

Enjoy :)

If you say you're getting good fps than you clearly haven't went to any of the other Regions. I hope they are planning on releasing another performance patch eventually. The fps is especially terrible in Caelid.

I just got the Lenovo g27q-20 and I love almost everything about it, (especially color since good color coverage is really important to me -like top priority) except the fact that it seems to be lagging. It‚Äôs a 165 hz screen with freesync but I know PS4 can‚Äôt do more than 60 and doesn‚Äôt support freesync. The new monitor has more lag than my old one did, which sucks but why? Is it because the new monitor can‚Äôt keep up at that low hz?
And what do I do? Would I be better off with a monitor that is clocked at 60 and not any higher?
I‚Äôm new to this so all this screen stuff is super confusing."

1,"Wifi Adapter not initializing So, this has been bugging me for a while. I'm going to head this off by saying that I'm an IT guy with over 20 years of experience in various IT domains and networking is one of them.

I have an Asus RT-AX58u router that has both 2.4 and 5GHz enabled. Within the same home/apartment I also have a residential Wifi AP. Here's what's been happening with my PS5 ever since I've had it:

I turn on the PS5, and it will say I am offline. I check the network settings, and it won't show ANY SSIDs at all. Scanning for networks shows nothing. It should be showing:
 - My router's SSID
 - My apartment community's Resident Wifi
 - My apartment community's Guest Wifi
 - Next-door neighboor's Wifi broadcasting capable devices (printers, routers, extenders, etc)

And these following steps will work intermittently, or not at all to get the WNIC to connect to the appropriate SSID:
 - Restart PS5
 - Put the PS5 in Rest Mode
 - Shut the PS5 down
 - Completely power cycling by unplugging the PS5 from power and pressing the power button to clear any charge from the PS5

It is getting rather frustrating to come home, turn on the PS5 from rest mode, to find that it lost connection to the network. I'd perform the above 4 steps, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, trying to get it to recognize ANY available SSIDs at all.

Is there a known issue with the PS5's NIC's to not initialize properly??? I have a hard time finding any resources online that discuss this... so I feel like I'm about to have to get Sony to service this thing. But, before I do, I wanted to see with the community if anyone else has had this issue."

Does anyone have some clue when this game will go on sale? I've been playing a library copy recently and really like it, which surprised me. But multiplayer kinda sucks as I rarely find people to summon and as unlikely I get summoned. Apparently this is a player base issue? If so, you'd expect a sale to increase that player base. On the other hand, it's been so popular that they may just continue to milk it for full price. I'd like to buy but I've waited so long for a deal I feel I'm already dug in and need to wait lol."

It started happening when I was playing Warzone and then after resetting the controller and console a couple of times it was still not working properly even in the ps5 Home Screen and menus. Oddly, I started playing FFX-HD and it was working fine the whole time but then when I go back into COD is stops working again. For some reason I have a strange feeling that COD itself is causing this because Warzone has done strange things to my ps4 and ps5 in the past and actually thing has made my DualShock 4 buttons stop working at times. I could be insane but just a thought since the controller was working with another game."

Mix water and fire and shoot steam at the enemies.

Have a friend shoot water at the enemies while you use shock for a devastating effect.

Combine protection and fire together to make fire enemies give you tremendous health whenever they use fire attacks.

You can even mix more than two to make even crazier combinations all while fighting orcs and goblins etc together. Careful *Friendly fire is on*.

You have like 8 different elements and have 4 different ways to apply them. The possibilities are crazy. Please try it."
1,"(Rant) Battlefield 2042 is an embarrassment to PS5 and Gamers Finally got my hands on a PS5. One of the games jammed into the ""Fuck You, you know you're still gonna buy it...""-package I begrudgingly purchased was 'Battlefield 2042'. I've played the OG classics, Hardline was bad but playable, 1 was thin but fun &amp; V was a good time (loved the tanks!)... 2042 is an abomination. 

The menus are an absolute mess and navigating them gets me closer to having a seizure than any of the piss poor graphics ever could. Speaking of which, whoever OK'd the final rendering of this game should be excommunicated from the gaming industry and the artists themselves should really consider other work. So many glitches too...

The weapon selection is pathetic, you get more options at a Bed and Breakfast. The ability to swap attachments mid game is pretty sweet, but again who cares when there's only 7 guns in the game. The class system has potential, but the crap menu layout makes it super confusing to navigate and I just lose interest.  Why would you assign so many different buttons to navigate a damn menu? I feel like I'm trying to solve a Rubik's cube changing a weapon load out.

The maps are massive but designed almost as if they don't want you to use vehicles... And the vehicles! Why are there so few! And why are there fewer options than ever?! Weak sauce EA... Speaking of which... Fuck EA.

For a system that's supposed to afford endless possibility, I feel really handcuffed to a style of play that just isn't fun in a game that doesn't even feel rushed, feels incomplete. Was really looking forward to a new Battlefield but I'm trading this in for whatever they'll give me. 

Says it all that they had to ham-hand it into package deals. Thankfully it included Elden Ring too. That way I can play a game designed by people vested in providing their customers with a quality product. Fuck EA, their brand killing greed &amp; shitty products."

1,"Returnal sucks, and it's entirely my fault. I enjoy the game, I enjoy the esthetic, the ambiance... but the story killed it for me. 

The game is smooth like butter. It took my one death to feel like I'd been playing for hours. The atmosphere of the game is amazing. I was getting some nice Lovecraft feels from it. It only took a few days to raise i wasn't going to finish it, I'm not usually a fan of roguelikes, but I have PS plus, so it was free. I little tidbits of plot the game gave me left me very intrigued so I hit up YouTube for a plot explanation video and that's when it really killed the game for me. 

Spoilers past this point. 

&gt;!Ok so the entire time I was getting those Lovecraft vibes I was excited. I was picturing some ancient evil awakening, some nether God that drove all the beings on the planet insane. Totally hooked. !&lt;

&gt;!Then I find out the whole things is in her head because she feels guilty for inadvertently causing the death of her daughter and being unable to save her. I felt ripped off. I wanted deities of unimaginable horrer psychically decimating every kind on a planet and delving further and further into the mental apocalypse that was there home...!&lt;

So yeah, that's why it sucks and it's entirely on me. Because my dumb ass wanted something other than what I got..."

Also on a different note, I'm playing Assassin's creed Valhalla and when the game saves there is a bit of lag, was wondering if it's normal."

1,"Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring. This is obviously my opinion so just keep that in mind.  


I've been a PlayStation first player since the early PS3-era, when the platform / first party was in the dumpster, and I was having lunch-time arguments in 8th grade about the merits of Folklore / Lair, over the likes of Gears of War and Bioshock...so in case anyone wants to question my bonafides there ya go.  


# Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring, and Ghost of Tsushima / Horizon are not nearly as good as you all say they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Some would claim that this started with the success of Uncharted and The Last of Us, but those games are phenomenal, and completely unlike the string of boring, predictable, safe, focus-tested, lifeless first-party exclusives they've come out with in the last several years.   


Horizon Zero Dawn  
Days Gone  
Ghost of Tsushima  
Horizon Forbidden West  
These games are all extremely similar structurally. Open worlds with lots of icons, objectives, gameplay variation...most of them have stealth grass, crafting, stealth kills, special melee finishers, loot, gear upgrades, skill trees, weapon upgrades...the list of familiar gameplay mechanics goes on and on. If you take away the window dressing of ""Samurai game"" or ""Robot dinosaur game"" or ""Zombie game"", they are almost identical in their design and gameplay, which is THE most important thing.

There are so many missions in Ghost that are trailing missions, or following footsteps...only to have a bunch of Mongol's be put in your way...you dispatch them and then the mission is usually over.

Horizon, despite having extremely awkward jumping and platforming, insists on making the player play dozens of missions that focus almost solely around jumping and platforming. Climbing on pre-determined, auto-win paths is not fun...it was the worst part of Uncharted and now it's in every Sony game. You want to see a game that did it right? Breath of The Wild...and I know that Guerrilla knows this game exists because they stole the glider mechanic straight from it.  


# Just because a game has a lot of dialogue and cutscenes doesn't mean the story / characters are good.

Aloy is one of the most insufferable game protagonists to come around in a long time. She is rude, humorless, talks down to people constantly, has no respect for the people around her, and worst of all she never shuts up or lets the player just play the game. I'd be rich if I had a quarter every time Aloy told a villager essentially, ""Shut up and let me handle this situation you toothless hillbilly...IF I HAVE TIME"". Who wants to play a game where the main character is an asshole to everyone?  


Jin Sakai, while not as much of an asshole as Aloy, is boring and bland as hell. He's conflicted about samurai vs ninja, but no matter what you do in the game, your choices don't matter and he ends up becoming a ninja anyway. Outside of being conflicted...what other terms would you use to describe Jin?  


Don't get me wrong - I think gaming is in a stronger place now than it's been in a long time, but god some of these games are so boring it makes my head spin."

NOT like SkinIt where the image doesn't go all the way around the controller, and *definitely* not a site like AimControllers where you have to pay extra for the base functions like Adaptive Triggers and a rumble pack."

1,"found a ps5 at a Walmart, someone bought it and returned it. it has a hole in the box and I'm worried it might be faulty or damaged. any advice? Randomly asked the entertainment section when they will have ps5s in stock. He said he has one, someone bought a bunch and returned this one. It has a hold in the box and when he tried to cash me out it wouldn't scan so he told me to come back Monday, June 27th. 

He said it works but I'm spending all my money on this ps5. He won't give me a discount because of the hole and I'm worried there might be an issue with the system.

Would appreciate some advice... thank you so much"

1,"[Xbox Gamer] FFVII Remake worth it? I'm mainly play on Xbox Series X, while extremely satisfied so far, 2022 will be dry, so I'll be back on it for MW2 Remake, and until Redfall &amp; Starfield.

Although, I finally got my PS5 recently! Got Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart and PS+ Premium (Ghost of Tsuishima, Returnal so far downloaded).

I never was a JRPG guy, I love Western RPG's (Skyrim, Witcher III, even the Assassin's Creed new formula since Origins) but I'm also a fan of Zelda, played all of the main franchise).

I've always hears about FFVII Remake and all the hype around it, I know the original was incredible for fans but I didn't have a PSone, I've started with PS2 and was mostly on Jak, Ratchet, Sly Cooper, etc...

Is the game really worth in your opinion for someone like me?

I'm thinking about Ocarina of Time in the way this game is perceived by fans of it, should I?

The tab for buying it is right in front of me and I can't be sure if I should make the purchase or not...

1,"How does upgrading to a higher PS Plus tier work after you add/stack existing 12-month Plus codes? I know a buddy who has 11 years of base Plus on his account and has an offer to upgrade it to Premium for $150 but I am offered the same upgrade price for my stacked 2 years. What gives? Is there a trick where there is a max charge to upgrade your existing stacked years of base PS Plus to Extra or Premium?  

I am just wondering why my offer is so close to his offer, for our remaining subscription, despite his having so many more years worth of plus stacked.  

By the way, I am comparing offers we both see on our consoles (both PS5‚Äôs).  

Is there any logic to this?  Does scaling take player where the more years you have stacked, the better the deal offered to upgrade for your remaining days?"

1,"Don't get ripped off My wife had been wanting for me to get a PS5 for a while and I refuse to pay scalpers so I decided to wait until plenty titles had been released and I had all the games to play when I got mine eventually. It was our anniversary and Father's day recently so she kept mentioning trying to get one. We signed up for the Playstation website list and Amazon list about a week ago. No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase. 

I hope you guys get your PS5 too!"

1,"Best microphone for the PS5? When I had the PS4, I used the Astro A40 with Mixamp. Both the standard included mic and the Mod Kit Mic were crystal clear. The setup for the PS5 was wonky and didn't work for me. So I ended up getting the Pulse 3D at launch. The Mic is fine on that but nothing good. You get what you pay for at $100 truth be told. Works fine. I have tried the SteelSeries 7p+ ($170), just to have everything in the background comes through. Recently tried the SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless ($350), Just to sound low in my opinion unless I cranked it up in settings. Which allows more background noise to appear. Once again not practical to me. Without waiting for the PS5 version of Astros to drop. Which could be another year or two. 

Is there anything remotely good currently? That blocks out the background noise and only allows in your voice basically? Or close to it? The Pulse does a decent good job, but given the mic is built in, I sound like shit compared to the A40s or the Nova Pro Wireless."

(Noting of course that these games also deal with very serious and/or end of the world type shit, but the overall vibe is still very light hearted.) So, what other light-hearted story driven games are out there?"

I wanted to try out some exclusives to just get a feel for the PS before I decide to buy one, what games would you say are must plays in this period of time?

I did play GoW years ago on PS4 and I'm not really feeling Horizon, too much open world bloat for me and I got my fill on open world earlier this year with Elden Ring. Is there any considerable difference between Horizon and Days Gone or Spider-Man where that open world fatigue wouldn't set in? 

I'm willing to shell out some money for a game, but not trying to spend a bunch to try a couple different games when I don't own the console.

1,Resident Evil 7: PS5 vs Xbox Series X/S patch - Ray-tracing + 120Hz modes tested! - Digital Foundry  
1,"Ape Escape 2 is a mess on PS5, but why I have hope it will be fixed So far the library of PS1 and PS2 is sparse. And personally I have no interest in the PS3 library through PS+ because my internet does not have the speeds to handle it. But if you have played Ape Escape 2 you'll notice a few things, that one it's the version that was ported to PS4 years ago when they did a short list of PS2 games for the PS4 early on the PS4's life. And two, it's broken on PS5 and they acknowledge that with a warning when you boot the game up which says to me that Sony knows that it's messed up on PS5. 

But why did I have hope they'll fix it? Because as said, the PS2 games that are on the service right now are the porter PS5 versions. For example Okage is the PS4 ported version dated from 2016. If you see the Jak and Daxter games they are also from the PS4 collection that was released awhile back. Unlike something like Ape Escape (the PSX original) that is dated for 6/13/22 here in the states, released again for this service. So I think that any further PS2 releases for PS+ will released for their service specifically, and again not like the few games they ported a few years ago on PS4. I think they'll fix Ape Escape 2 once they actually start getting to the PS2 games which will probably come with things like save states etc like we've seen with the PS1 titles.

And hopefully we'll finally get a rerelease of Ape Escape 3 since they rated it again back in 2020, but didn't release anything."

Now guys, that's all well and good, I don't want to blurt out on the PlayStation Plus topic, really I swear I'm okay with literally everything and everyone has their own opinion about it....but, holy HELL, but will you please explain to me what is the point of giving us """"""free"""" PS1 AND PSP games purchased digitally at the time, while PS2 AND PS3 games are not? I swear to you guys, I feel taken for a ride in an unbelievable way.

Either they were doing it for all consoles or not at all, but I say what's the point of doing it like this, half-heartedly, just for the content to make people feel good?

I am dumbfounded, I repeat I'm really okay with anything, 120$  a year for two games in a cross TO ME IS OK, everyone can choose whether to do it or not, no one is obligated....but there is a f\*cking limit to the transparency a company can have, and this is really one of the most treacherous and disgusting moves I've ever seen.

And don't tell me ""if you want to play PS2 and PS3 games you bought on the Store at the time get yourself a PS3"" because that's not the point, the point is the disrespect towards their fanbase, the wanting to take advantage of every last penny.

Me:copy paste from the other person i just spoke with

Me:basically the link i got for the ps5 event seems to be broken

Erick:We‚Äôre very sorry to read that and allow me to explain, at the moment you are contacting PS tech support and unfortunately we don‚Äôt have all the proper tools to help you with your specific situation. Allow me point you to the right direction. You have to contact PS direct support chat here: [https://psdirect.com/chat](https://psdirect.com/chat)

At the bottom you will see the option to chat with them. In case you see the option is grayed out, that means their chat waiting queue is at max capacity so my recommendation for you would be wait for the option to become available so you can start to chat with them. They will be more than glad to help you!  

Do you have any other question for me or something else I could help?

Erick:Thank you for contacting PlayStation, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day

  
Guy disconnected before I could say anything.  Shockingly, the direct support button is greyed out.  And I continue to have no solution to actually buy this thing, or even verify if my link is working.  I'm blown away by how badly this is going through the official channel to buy a PS5.  To be clear, I get that these guys were just doing their jobs, I just don't know what Sony is expecting me to do here."

1,"I should love Far Cry 6, but I kind of hate it. Far Cry 6 has a fun story and the characters are pretty excellent. There is a lot of heart in Far Cry 6's narrative, but the open world has no real soul, and the UI feels sluggish and dated.

Simply put, the things you do in the open world and how you are meant to traverse it--are monotonous. We all know what Ubisoft games are like so there's no need to go into great detail here.

I want to talk briefly about the UI.

When you start the game, you always get a voiced menu-narrator that says ""Press cross to start"" or something like that. At first it's like, cool accessibility. But you never have the option of turning it off. That's a little thing though, right?

But once you're in the game you start seeing those lazy design choices like having to enter the pause menu every time you want to switch your supremo device. Or having to drag your cursor around the menu screen to select things like you're playing with a mouse and keyboard. Or having to enter the pause menu again if you want to dismiss your companion.

What annoys me most though is how the main character can only grab certain ledges in the game. I frequently find myself stand right next to a fence or stairwell or rock that I can't climb because the game wants me to find the yellow painted wall that I'm allowed to climb to reach an item or vantage point. This is just egregious and a huge step back as far as modern open world games are concerned.

This game feels like such a contrast to Far Cry 5 which I feel had a really good balance of open world distractions and mission design; I was never really bored with Far Cry 5. (Hopefully it gets a console update).

I know this is all over the place.

TL/DR: Far Cry 6 is a waste of time."

1,"My Replacement PS5 - A LONG Journey So. Back in June 2021 I was lucky enough to get myself a PS5 (disc version) console for RRP without really trying that hard if I'm honest.

Flash forward from June 2021 to May of this year. The 12th to be exact. A day that will haunt me.

I had just installed Evil Dead The Game (E/D) and the new PS5 firmware update - like many people had I assume.

20 mins into E/D and the PS5 screen went black, an almighty ""scream"" type audio rumbled out of the speakers on my TV and the PS5 went off.

""Okay. That was weird. Damn game.""

Turned it back on and loaded E/D back up again. 

4 or 5 minutes later...

Green screen. PS5 powers off.

""What a dogsh** game!""

Threw the game back in the cupboard and put (I'm ashamed to say) Fortnite on. Played for 2 or 3 hours. No issues. 

A couple of days pass, maybe a week, during which I'm discussing E/D with some mates and how annoying it is that the game is unplayable.

""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Mine doesn't crash."" ""I've not had any problems.""

Not what I wanted to hear.

I do a bit of research. 

'PS5 green screen....' comes back with issues ranging from software, HDMI leads popping out or a bad GPU.

I keep telling myself that it was the game - Fortnite was okay. No issues at all. I decided I'm going to test it out again. I don't even get past E/Ds loading screen this time. Green screen. Power off.

I reset the console. Same issue.
I option 7 the console. Same issue.

ONLY with E/D.

I'm playing Far Cry 6, Valhalla, Fortnite, all without issue.

To be on the safe side I contact Sony through their online portal. 

I ask them outright if the firmware has caused this. Knowing a few people have had firmware issues previously.

They tell me to send it back if I like because it ""might"" be broken. Even though I'm playing it. 

""What!?""

They give me a case number. Let's say 666X666 and instructions on how to package my PS5 for return. (I'm in the UK - They give you a label and nothing else.)

There's no way it's broken though. I'm playing it whilst reading their email. How can they say it might not work when I'm literally playing it?

Flash another week. It's playing everything except E/D.

June 10th 2022. Or as I now call it. 

Sony PlayStation Fried-day.

It's 0830 and I just got in from a night shift. Figured I'd do some looting and shooting before bed so I turn it on. Fortnite loads because I want something easy.

30 seconds later. Green screen. Power off. Reboot. 30 seconds. The same. Reboot. 20 seconds. Black screen. (That's new). Power off.

I pull the leads out. Use a whole roll of bubble wrap and mail the PS5 at 1032 in the morning. Gone. 

When Sony give you your case number they also give you a link to track your return. That evening, just because I'm bored I type in 666X666 and my postcode. 

[In transit to us.]

Cool. 

I then check Royal Mail tracking who confirmed the same.

What follows is a breakdown of what happend next.

11th [In transit to us]
13th [In transit to us]
14th [You do not have access to view this page] 

I figured that was an error but I was away for a couple of days so wasn't spending hours on the phone sorting it out. Fired them a quick email anyway. 

Royal Mail told me it was delivered to the distribution centre but that's as far as their tracking goes because Sony then use a different service.

16th [You do not have access to view this page]

I had no choice but to call the number I got from Twitter.

Gave them all my details. Explained I'd been locked out of tracking to be told they'd received my unit on the 11th. So the tracking was wrong anyway. It was now at the repair centre and would be back with me in 14 - 21 days. Even though the website says 15 max. Okay fine. Doesn't bother me. I work a lot anyway.

17th June 2022 I received an email asking me to rate the service I'd received and informing me my PS5 was yet to be received but they'd keep in touch. I was confused. The person on the phone said they'd received it at the repair centre on the 11th. Now 6 days later they don't have it? 

Obviously I call them again to be told I don't exist. Not my tracking number. Me. They've no record of ever speaking to me via the phone or emails. Luckily I screen capped the emails which I promptly sent over.

18th June I get two emails telling me;

*Your PS5 has been received and the repairs team are working on it. 

*Your PS5 is still in transit to the repair centre.

I can't call them because the call centre is closed Sat and Sun - so I send back a very polite email explaining I will call them first thing Monday the 20th June and I want to know WTF is happening.

20th June and I give them a ring. I'm INSTANTLY put through to a manager. They don't even ask. They just tell me they're doing it as soon as I say who I am.

I explain that I'm fine with it taking 14 - 21 days - it doesn't bother me. I just want proper confirmation they have it as so far I've been told it's not there, it is there, I don't exist... etc

The manager tells me the following... 

""We recieved the console this morning at the distribution centre. It will be sent to the repairs centre today and you will have it back by the 28th June.""

Awesome. I thank him, hang up the phone and go about my day. 

1656 on the same day I receive an email...

""We are pleased we could assist you and are now closing your case.""

Closing the case? You've still got my console. I think not.

I try to call but they close at 1700 apparently. 

21st June 2022 I'm straight on the phone. 

The woman tells me that I received my console at 1029 that morning (yesterday). ""The f*** I have...""

She goes off to get a manager who spends the next twenty minutes calling me a liar and saying they have a signature, proof of delivery, etc etc 

I ask them to forward me an email containing all of this information and tell them I will be in London that afternoon, at their office to show them my security footage from my house.

Suddenly the manager says...

""Oh. Sorry. Your console will be there today between 1330 and 1530"".

I'm still angry from being called a liar and say;

""I still want the proof of delivery you have from 1029 this morning though. Ya know. My signature. A photo. Whatever it was you have there in front of you...""

He hung up.

1525 Brand new, replacement PS5 - in a brown box (no PS5 box) turns up and I don't even have to sign for it because the DPD drivers machine isn't working.

I genuinely believe that they knew the firmware messed it up, they had it on the 11th, they then lost it between the 12th and 14th and thought I wouldn't check - locking me out of tracking intentionally, didn't want to repair it and finally I think if I hadn't have caused such a fuss I believe they would still be maintaining I'd got it back even when I hadn't.

TLDR 

PS5 Blew up. Sony lost it. Claims I had it back when I didn't and had proof. Only when I mentioned my home security did they say otherwise. Replaced the console in a rubbish brown box."

Death stranding was developed by Kojima (non PS studio), similarly Remakes of Demons Souls and Shadow of collossus were developed by Sony owned studios but their original productions were from different studios. So I wanted to ask if you guys know who owns these IPs? Can Sony produce their sequels in future or Sony needs some kind of license from their original studios? 
Thank you"

I don‚Äôt own a PS5 but I got the chance to house sit for my sister and her husband while they were on vacation and they had a ps5, so I of course played it and it was my first time gaming in a long time. I fired up the new ratchet and clank game and loved every minute. Having the triggers give you a different feeling for each gun was awesome and being able to pull it back half way to fire slowly and then pulling it back all the way to fire faster was a really cool expirence. Today is my first day back at my house and I fired up my Xbox series x with gears 5 and realized how blank firing weapons felt. It really feels like something is missing and now I really want a ps5."

1,"PSA for PS premium subscribers: jak 3 is (technically) broken so as we all know, sony released the new ps plus tiers recently. and as we also know, the classics catalog is extremely barebones, which is disappointing. the ps2 catalog literally has only 4 games in it, and those are the jak and daxter games. ok sweet, those are some cool classics, and one of sony's most beloved mascot platformers. so with the lack of other ps2 games on the catalog, you'd think that sony would have done everything to make sure that these games are delivered to us in the most utmost condition right? WRONG! 

for those of you who decide to start paying 120 bucks per year, you need to know that this game cannot be platinumed for a large quantity of players, on both ps4 and ps5. trophies come with all 4 jak games, so they're clearly an advertised feature of the new ps plus service. well, this is just to let you know that many players out there, including myself, cannot get the platinum trophy because the game is glitched. 

if you attempt to platinum the game, you need to obtain all 600 precursor orbs, the primary collectible in the game, and ofc this has a couple trophies tied to it. problem is that gaining all of these is impossible for some people. there are numerous side challenges in the game that do not award their orbs upon completion. I finished doing the wasteland run race today, and despite beating the gold medal requirement, I wasnt awarded with any trophies for the challenge. i've tried replaying it numerous times, to no avail. and this isn't the only challenge that awards orbs either. im currently at 576/200 orbs and im a hundred percent positive that i've done everything that im supposed to do for all the other orbs. i've found all the collectible ones via youtube guides, and i've gotten all the orbs related to the various in-game mini games. but it would seem that some challenges do not properly give you the orbs, most notably the races. my high score tab in the pause menu has shown me clearing every single gold medal time for every challenge, and yet im still short on 24 orbs. for some people it might be slightly less, and for some slightly more. nobody knows what the issue is for sure because neither sony nor naughty dog have ever fixed this issue.

the game is currently running on version 1.02, and it doesnt appear to be possible to delete the game and attempt to play it on version 1.00, since you need to be connected to the internet to redownload the game, and doing so prompts you to download the most recent update as well, which presumably broke progression. it was originally released in 2017 as part of the jak and daxter bundle, and even now in 2022 this has not been fixed. for those who bought it digitally, this was already insulting, but the fact that sony chose to voluntarily put these games onto their new premium service which they're charging people for, just for them to find out that they cant obtain the platinum either, is a whole new level of disrespectful. you'd think that with the ps2 catalog being as pathetic as it is, they would have done everything in their power to polish these emulated games as much as possible. there have been numerous other threads made on reddit regarding this issue, but nothing was ever done. 

my hope is that this post can bring some awareness to this issue and get sony to release a new update for it, since they're essentially charging for an advertised feature that doesnt work properly for a lot of people. there are NO missable collectibles in jak 3, but some of them definitely are glitched, and need to be fixed ASAP, because this reflects poorly on sony."

The left thumb stick started drifting around 2 weeks ago and I know way too well that's it's going to become worse. I am not looking for solutions, I tried resetting it and all and I'm not going to unscrew everything in order to fix it because I still have the warranty.

Since I have the warranty there shouldn't be a problem but the store I bought the console will ask me to send the PS5 too. I do find to be an annoying process and I would prefere to send only the controller.

My plan is to buy a controller from the same store and switch the controllers but I don't know if there is any way for anyone to see if I switched them or not."

1,"Activity Cards are still poorly implemented. We are 20 months into the console generation and the biggest ""innovation"" that came with PS5's new UI, the activity cards, are still wasted potential.

They seemed like such a cool feature pre-launch. Jumping in your save file right from the home screen rather than having to go through the game's main menu? Yes please!
Offering tips and tricks for when you get stuck or want to unlock a trophy? Awesome.
And so much more...

But let's be real, who actually uses them?

I think there are two main issues that need to be fixed ASAP:

1. Visibility: when you press the home button mid game the activity cards will immediatly pop up. That's great. But how about when you view the game from the home screen? E.g. in order to select the activity card that boots you right into your most recent save file. Well, you actually have to press downwards twice on the controller. That's terrible. You won't even be seeing the avtivity cards unless you actively seek them out. So I personally forget to use them most of the time eventhough I could boot into the game much faster.

2. Consistency: there is zero consistency between games. Is there an activity card for loading my most recent save? Are there activity cards with tips and tricks? How do these activity cards look like? I simply don't know. Because of that I can never build muscle memory like ""pressing down and square will always launch the activity card that boots my most recent save"". Instead I always have to search for the card I'm looking for... if it even exists that is.

Possible solution: Sony need to make a few mandates that all new games will have to follow. The most important one in my opinion is that there has to be a Resume activity card that boots you right into your save file. This card also has to be the first card you see when selecting a game from the home screen. Secondly Sony need to rework their UI to make it more easy to understand at a glance what an activity card does and they need to make it easier to view and select an activity card from the home screen. They should probably go even further and include a hotkey that will immediatly load your save file. E.g. loading your most recent save directly from the home screen by pressing the square button.

What are your thoughts?"

1,"Elden Ring Bosses' song lyrics are not in any language and thus cannot be translated [ Info offiacially confirmed] Read attentively till the end.  Salve. I am a Latin student and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs.

The first one I analysed was 'song of lament, not a boss theme, (aka song of the bats) whose lyrics are indeed in Latin. I contacted the lyricist who wrote them 3 months ago and then (for my surprise) I was told that only those were written by that person. Then I published those Latin lyrics and their translation at the time (Games from Mars channel got them from me and thus fairly credited me in his video) and I was looking forward to finding another Latin song in Elden Ring. 

For that purpose,  I contacted some music producers who worked in Elden Ring and they confirmed that 99% of the lyrics in the game are not in any language at all and don't mean anything. 

I have recently published some of my conversations with them on r/eldenringdiscussion by the way.

The Elden Ring music producers explained that the lyrics were computer generated and adjusted to sound like ancient languages.

 In order to help my research on the use of random syllables to simulate ancient languages in game songs, I was given the official lyrics and I have been analysing them carefully. Check out Mohg's official lyrics for example:   [https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI](https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI)  

As you could see, some times the lyrics resemble Latin, but they are not in Latin. The goal was to simulate ancient languages songs to enhance the dramatic feel of the player's experience.

I know it may be frustrating to know about it, but I was told that process is quite common in video games actually.

Sadly a wave of fake news last week about 'translations' of Elden Ring Bosses song lyrics spread pretty fast. I talked to youtuber Vaati and (fortunately) he is aware those are fake translations. So be careful, let your ears know 99% of Elden Ring song lyrics are computer generated syllables created to simulate ancient languages songs.

Cheers,

1,"Why game should I get??? I‚Äôm looking for something very good that I can play for a long time. 


I‚Äôm considering elden ring, I‚Äôm not great at videogames but if I grind I can probably become decent and the long one gameplay time is temping. I also have no friends lol so it may not be very easy finding ppl on Reddit that want to play with a not so smart beginner lol

Sifu looks very cool too. Ngl it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôd get stuck and never be able to complete it. Not sure tho tbh. 

I‚Äôve thought about uncharted or Spider-Man remastered but I‚Äôd be so bored even if it is higher quality. I also wondered about forbidden west but the gameplay time is too short tbh

Ghostwire: Tokyo is the weirdest and dumbest game I've played on my PS5. 

It runs really wonky on my PS5 and when I say wonky I mean, really slow because of the detail in the assets of the game.

There's no real action in this game except for you and the enemies.

I didn't realize in order to play a game I have to spend my time reading subtitles.

I looked up comments about this game before I received it and most people gave it 5/5 saying it was the most incredible experience, blah, blah, blah.

1,"Visible screw when using the PS5 base vertically? Question in title. I've normally had my PS5 horizontal on the base, but just got a new TV stand and can finally set up my system vertically.

I tried to make sure the stand was as flush and secure against my system before i tightened the base screw. I have noticed though, that if you look really low from the front, there is a gap between the console and the stand, and quite a bit of the screw is visible.

Can anyone else please confirm if theirs is the same way and that this is normal? Sorry for worrying, i will feel much better if it is just how it is supposed to be.

Thanks folks! I hope everyone is doing well and having fun with their systems!"
1,"PS5 unplugged in rest mode Yesterday afternoon my PS5 was unplugged while in rest mode(just a mistake from the power strip, wasn't downloading or playing anything just charging a controller) and after I turned it back on I did the normal repair, restarted and everything was fine. I've noticed no issues in any games, but I was playing Ghost this afternoon and I'm seeing a weird visual bug. When moonlight/light is hitting the bamboo it creates this weird white outline on the trees. It only is showing at certain angles but still a concern I don't remember seeing it before and hoping it has nothing to do with the console not being shut off properly.

https://imgur.com/4VgxcSY

Is this normal within the game or did something happened to the console because it was unplugged while in rest mode? Again I'm not seeing any problems in any other game it could just be related to Tsushimas engine? Has anyone noticed this before? Thanks in advance."

About a month ago a message popped up on my screen notifying me that my PS5 was getting too hot and needed to be powered off. It was in fact a little dusty so I cleaned it, thinking that was for sure the issue. But now it seems that when I play a PS5 game for an extended period of time it displays this same message. And I have to power it off or it will force shutdown. I got on YouTube to see what the problem could be. That's when I noticed there are a lot of other people that are having this exact same issue. Which started about a month ago or so. Some think a software update caused this issue. I'm frustrated because I visit PS5 reddit page a lot to see what's new.. and to generally stay informed about things. But I haven't really seen any posts about PS5's overheating. What's really going on??

I think these come to regular stores in a month or so, but for now they're only available on PlayStation Direct's website.

Anyways, [here's a link to the album for it.](https://imgur.com/a/3WRBaSG) If you've ever removed the side panels to install an SSD, the process is exactly the same. If you haven't, it's pretty simple: Unscrew the base, pull up from the top corner and push towards the bottom of the console and it'll come off cleanly. It takes a bit more force than you might expect. Then you just slide the new ones in. It comes with instructions if you aren't sure how it goes."

1,"Smaller titles made by Playstation Studios idea Playstation Studios are expanding EVERYTHING right now. Better graphics, better sound, accessibility options and so on.

I was wondering it would be cool to see some smaller titles for a change from them. No need to think is this good for wide audience, just experiment and go wild!

People have expectations when they see Naughty Dog logo  in a teaser trailer. Many would laught their asses of if they see something ""indie"" from them.

How about new, smaller studio that would cycle people between projects? Small platformer made by people from Naughty Dog and Insomniac games? Puzzle game made by Sucker Punch and San Diego studio? And so on...

I know it is stupid to think they just let people go at the same time they hire, and it would be smarter to just build new ""indie"" studio with new talent to focus on simple games. But it would be cool to see what kind of games all talented people at Playstation Studios could create together while having fun.

And to be clear, I love God Of War, Uncharted, and many other big budget game. Just some thoughts. :)"

From my understanding that puts its somewhere in the middle of a sata3 ssd and a gen 3 m.2. 

Prices are pretty reasonable for gen3 m.2 these days so it wouldn't be outrageous to get a 1tb and enclosure. At the same time I could probably get a 2tb sata for about the same price, but that is only about 4Gbps, so missing out on a lot of speed.

1,"Looking for a PS5 game with infinite replayability Greetings,

As per the title, I am looking for PS5 game recommendations that I can play forever without ""completing"" it.  What I mean by that is games like Civilization, Stardew Valley, driving/racing like Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, etc. I'd also prefer it to be a offline and solo game.

The idea is to be able to have one game I can always count on to be there; to be able to play without having it be one of those games where you finish the story and you're basically done with it. Even if its a dumb long RPG game like Soulsbourne or ElderScrolls games because eventually I could run through the game with each class/build. By infinite I truly mean infinite to no end. 

I'd prefer it to be a laid back/relax after a long day of work type of game.  Turn based would be nice or a chill adventure type thing like stardew where there is no pressure to commit so much attention for a long period of time, itd be nice to get up and move a bit here and there. Like getting up between races on mario kart or between days on stardew, in between turns on a turn based game.

I know it's a lot but my dream is to find this game that can satisfy my gaming itch no matter when it comes up."

1,"I Feel Like the New PS Plus Is Not Good Value for Money Hello everyone,

¬£10.99 for ""Essentials"" is a bit much, especially as you have to pay an extra ¬£3 to access classics under premium at ¬£13.99. 

A lot of people are raving about 400 games!!! But it's 2022. Most of these games are dirt-cheap now and you can buy a PS3 for around ¬£60 with games on Ebay. 

Incidentally, I also feel the same about Xbox Gamepass - in that most games are dirt-cheap. Except they at least include EA, backward compatible catalog of original Xbox, 360 and Xbox One games for the same as Essentials at ¬£10.99.

I know it's early days, but I don't believe in subscription based game passes. You'll argue, ""no one is forcing you to buy it"", but it has serious ramifications for the industry as a whole. It demotivates developers, subscription prices ALWAYS rise regardless of the economy, so you end up paying more. It's very telling that PS didn't even attempt to undercut Microsoft's Gamepass or factor in rising costs....hubris? I don't know."

1,"Redout 2 first impressions So I‚Äôve been playing Redout 2 on ps5 for a couple of hours and I‚Äôm very impressed with it. The sense of speed is amazing, very exhilarating and whilst the control of ship can take some time to get used to, it‚Äôs really satisfying once you do.
The graphics are sharp and the tracks vibrant and it zips past at a really smooth 60 fps. I‚Äôve been wanting a new fzero or wipeout for ages and redout 2 is exactly what I‚Äôve waiting for.
If you‚Äôre fan of the wipeout games or indeed f zero, you should definitely check it out. Thumbs up from me so far."

When I try and stream them instead, the 'connection too slow' error appears constantly, even with ALL other devices turned off. 

I've tried rebooting, unplugging the console, moving the games between drives, booting in safe mode and rebuilding the database, restoring my licenses, everything I've read that could be causing this. I unfortunately have a 1.5TB data cap, and this is burning through it like mad. Any ideas or advice? At my wit's end here."

Will they be adding AAA games every month or is it just gonna be similar to the old PlayStation Plus. I did read that they won‚Äôt be releasing their 1st party games to it at least at launch which is okay in my opinion, but do they have plans to release them there let‚Äôs say a year after the release date? 

I am also curious what you all think they will release there in the future as well as what you hope they release there, for me personally I hope they release Dreams on it at the very least. 

I know they aren‚Äôt going to try to directly compete with Microsoft in this area but still what do you think the overall goal of it will be as well as the quality of PS5 games that they will bring to it. 

I just upgraded myself for death stranding, demon souls, and also to try the cyberpunk demo, and I will try a few of the others I don‚Äôt have, but I do have all of the PS5 games on the list besides those two. 

Do you think we will get PS5 games every month or will it just be PS4 and old PS3 games being added, as well as Indie games?"

While this hasn‚Äôt been a problem I now realize that my speed seems to be slow when playing 2k22 online. After playing on tvs/monitor with 1080pp I‚Äôve been able to hit shots more consistently. So, I guess my problem has been my tv.

If this is accurate I could use some advice on getting a new monitor/tv. I‚Äôm hoping to buy something about 32 inches for no more than $300. Does anyone have any recommendations? Should I look for a 4k? Should the response time for the monitor matter? What should I consider?"

1,"New soccer fan, Fifa 22 vs eFootball for me? As a new fan of soccer who is planning to enjoy some gaming action, which would you focus your time and small amount of money towards? I own both thanks to being f2p and free via ps+

For some more insight as to what I would like to achieve...

I plan on playing daily. Not interested I competitive online gaming at the moment. Depending on how I feel down the line I might try and pretend like I'm a pro. I don't care about story modes or season modes. I strictly plan on playing where I can collect/level up/trade/buy/sell/unlock players to improve my team. I have no issues with spending some money towards q game I will enjoy, I will not invest my life savings just to be able to have a good team that can be competitive. 

Please note, I currently own both games and have played a few matches of both games. In eFootball I focus on Dream Team and Fifa 22 I focus on FUT. I like the slower gameplay of eFootball more so than Fifa, but it is completely barebones as hell when it comes to any sort of customization and there is no marketplace to sell players. Fifa on the other hand looks way better, has better presentation and plenty of customization options including a market place. However the game feels to fast paced and the marketplace to me implies more money needed to be spent. I like aspects of both games, ideally if I could combine them to make 1 game I would. 

With that being said, short term and long term, overall, which game would you focus more on completely? I don't want to be bouncing between both. Based on what I've described and based on your own opinion/experience. 

Cheers"

Already tried turning off the console, deleting the game and reinstall it and checked the internal storage which has enough space for the game. One thing that I noticed is that the disc stopped making noise when the copy reached 99%. I hope this question hasn't been already made and some feedback would be very much appreciated.

1,"Soundbar users, what settings do you have enabled to remove audio lag? Hello all,

I recently got a soundbar, but I have been noticing some lag between the audio and video. It looks like the sound comes in delayed. I made a posting on r/Soundbars but I figured it might be a good idea to post here too since I'm using my PS5, maybe someone knows how to fix my issue.

Here is my hardware setup:

PS5 connected to [Samsung TV's](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-55-class-7-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv/6401735.p?skuId=6401735) HDMI via stock HDMI cable

TV eARC HDMI port connected to [Samsung soundbar's](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/home-theater/sound-bars/hw-b650-3-1ch-soundbar-w-dolby-5-1-dts-virtual-x-2022-hw-b650-za/) ARC port (not eARC)

Here are the things I've tried:

The first thing I tried was using the optical cable. The manual does say to use a hi speed HDMI w/ Ethernet and I just grabbed some random, generic HDMI that came with a monitor I bought recently for my PC. That did not resolve the issue, audio lag was the same

My original setup was PS5 stock HDMI into Soundbar HDMI and then soundbar ARC HDMI to TV eARC so basically everything going through the soundbar, but that capped my PS5's resolution to 1080p which made the picture really crisp because it's a 4K TV, but everything was way over saturated and there were noticeable artifacts on the screen. I'm not sure if this was a limitation of the soundbar being ARC and the TV being eARC or if there were some settings I had to tinker with on both TV and PS5 but I didn't bother because originally I thought I was using it wrong having it hooked up like that

I tried audio sync on my TV, but that didn't seem to do anything, and audio sync on the sound bar only made it worse, and it was already set to 0. I thought there might be negative values like on the TV settings, but there weren't it only went from 0 to like 200 

I saw somewhere that switching to DTS Virtual X helps with latency but that didn't help with my situation.

I also went into my TV's expert settings and changed the audio output to Pass-Through (other options are PCM and Auto).

On the PS5 I also have audio options for PCM, Dolby and DTS. I saw somewhere that Dolby would be the best if I'm using ARC, but that didn't fix the issue. I did see a marginal improvement, but it was minimal, and the lag is still very apparent"

1,"Using Ps4 and Ps5 alternatively ? Can I use my Ps4 and Ps5 alternatively and keep my game data synced? The consoles would be in 2 different locations with the same Ps4 games on both consoles with the same PSN account on both. I'd like to know if I switch from one to the other if the data from my games will be updatedh if I use the UPLOAD DATA option. This way I could avoid hauling my console from one place to another.

Current examples of games are NHL 22 - Franchise Mode, Horizon Zero Dawn and The Division 2.

I play in one place during the week on the Ps4 and on weekends, Ps5 at a different location. 

I haven't found much elsewhere or on YT."

I personally feel as of now there isn't any real reason to have Pro version of console, especially when just finding and getting a PS5 has been difficult.
PS4 Pro came at right time console had been out for long time and games started to feel like they could use some more power from console, but for PS5 I can't see that happening in a while.
Interested to hear do you think if there is need for Pro console this generation and when would be right time to release it?"

1,"PS2 Classics still 50 hz PAL versions in North American territories? For some reason my previous post was reported and removed. I think there may have been some confusion as to what I was claiming, so I would like to clarify: **PS1 Classics on the new PS Plus Premium service are the original 60hz NTSC versions in North American territories.** This is good.

**However, PS2 Classics are still the 50hz PAL versions for me when I download them onto my NTSC PS5.** This is not good. A notable example is Ape Escape 2, which is very clearly the PAL version as evidenced by the game's splash screen displaying [""Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Presents""](https://i.imgur.com/2MWrRj0.jpg).

[I'm also experiencing graphical glitches with the HUD](https://i.imgur.com/wqv74KL.jpg), which I also encountered last year when I first tried booting up this specific title on my PS5.

Basically, it would seem **Sony has not updated their PS2 Classic titles for PS Plus Premium, only the PS1/PSP Classic titles.** This isn't conjecture on my part, but a fact for me at least (N=1). I'm curious if anyone else has been impacted by this same issue. If not then perhaps Sony is rolling out NTSC updates for PS2 Classic titles in a staggered manner."

1,"I don‚Äôt have a PS5 yet, how does the DRM work? I‚Äôm specifically wondering about the backwards compatibility. 

If your PS5 is completely offline and you put in a PS4 disc and let it install, can you run the game without having to connect to the internet? I only ask because when you put an Xbox One game into a Series X, it has to be connected to the internet to finish the install. I‚Äôm assuming this has to do with you having to have the latest game patch installed for proper compatibility. So does this same issue exist on PS5?

I should clarify that I‚Äôm not talking about the free upgrades to games, but simply playing a PS4 game on PS5. 

If somebody who owns a PS5 could check this for me, I‚Äôd be really thankful as I haven‚Äôt been able to find the answer I‚Äôm looking for online."

am alone ?"
1,"PS2 Classics on new PS Plus Premium are still the juddery 50hz PAL versions North American here. Just tried Ape Escape 2 and a few other PS2 Classic titles on PS5. Got an ominous warning that ""PS4 games may not playback currently on PS5."" I can confirm that many of these games are still the 50hz PAL releases. Ape Escape 2 is notably bad, with graphical glitches galore. 

I had hoped Sony would update their PS2 Classics catalogue to the NTSC versions and ensure compatibility for PS5 users, but nope. Got shafted again."
1,Looks like every time you try to stream a game that is available on ps4 as well as ps5 Sony defaults to the ps4 version. Just an FYI Maybe I'm wrong but I have the new service and I have tried every title that's split between the two consoles and it always forces the previous generation
1,"What classic games do you hope to see added to the new Playstation Plus at some point? Hoping at some point we get the PS2 Ratchet and Clank trilogy, all the Metal Gear Solid games, and the Kingdom Hearts games added.

These were all legendary games from the PS2 era so was quite surprised to not see any of them on the list."

On my Xbox there's a Trueachievements app that is integrated into the Xbox achievements system where you can click on an ancient and get guides, advice etc on how to get the achievements.
Is there an equivelent on PlayStation?

1,"Was it worth upgrading? So now the PS5 has been out for a while, what are owners thoughts on upgrading to it, was it worth the extra money?
I read there are still not many games out yet.

I have a PS4 pro that works perfectly, I keep thinking, if it is time to upgrade.

Then I think, why bother. If I didn't have a Pro, or it broke, then it would make sense, but as it is I'll keep my pro.

Maybe there are a few players who still have both set up. What are your thoughts?"

1,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Unrated Gameplay Trailer  
1,"Sony needs to add LFC (low framerate compensation)! Yeah just tried a little bit of the Resident Evil 2 PS5 Patch and I have that game on both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 and it‚Äôs really obvious that the PS5 has no LFC. The framerate in the raytracing mode often falls under 48 fps and on PS5 that creates clearly visible and distracting stuttering. The Xbox version also falls unter 48fps (from my limited analysis via the VRR information on my LG CX I would say they are the same performance wise, where PS5 falls under 48 fps and shows 59hz in VRR into Xbox is around 90 ¬± 3 fps in the info which makes it around 43-44 fps due to frame doubling) but because LFC is working it‚Äôs doubling frames and it‚Äôs much MUCH more smoother experience on Xbox. 

It‚Äôs a little but frustrating because I really would like to play 2 and 3 on PlayStation 5 (because I‚Äôm weird and Resident Evil are ‚ÄúPlaystation Games‚Äù in my head, also DualSense!) but in this case Series X is clearly the much better experience. 

I really hope Sony adds system wide LFC. I know developers can add an own implementation of LFC similar to what insomniac did in Spider-Man but I believe it would help especially for third party developers to implement it an a system level.

Also, not all of the games have 4 or more reviews, in that instance I just took an average or used a different platform's review.

Hope some people find this useful, there's some titles in there that I'd never heard of that have pretty decent reviews. Also, it's worth noting that a lot of these games are quite old and might not have scored as highly by today's standards, so KNACK is probably more of a 95 than a 100.

1,"Games still locked after restoring purchases. So I‚Äôve had my PS5 for a few months now, and some games have always been locked for me such as Friday the 13th and Ghost of Tsushima. I‚Äôve restored licenses three times, I‚Äôve tried disabling and enabling Console sharing and offline play. But still some games remain locked, even though I‚Äôve purchased those games. I‚Äôm not game sharing with anyone, and the only other account I have on my console is my brother‚Äôs, I‚Äôve done the same thing on his account, still nothing. I‚Äôve checked the web, and tried about everything I‚Äôve seen, nothing, so please Reddit, I‚Äôm counting on you!"
1,"PSA: Wild Arms (PS Classic) showing as free! I just noticed it on the PS App in the store.. I'm an essential tier PS Plus member and was able to ""purchase"" it for free. Wondering if it's like this for everyone. Didn't see it posted at all so check it out! Here's the link

1,"Why Sony? Being a ps plus subscriber I have to pay for free upgrade. Recently Resident Evil 7 got a free ps5 upgrade.

As a PSplus subscriber, I already claimed this game but I can't play it because I have to pay extra for upgraded graphics.

That also means if Red Dead Redemption 2 gets an upgrade (free or not). I still have to pay extra if I claim it through PSplus.

Now I'm wondering, should I buy the game or play using PSplus?"

I ve seen some videos on youtube that when they go to users and accounts &gt; they have a tab called ‚Äúusers‚Äù (Also theres a option to add users straight from there) but mine says Delete users instead of users and I can‚Äôt add users from there. Why is that?"

1,"How much should I expect to pay for a ps5 secondhand? I've been messaging this guy on kijiji who is selling a ps5, an extra controller, and a charging dock for 930 CAD.

It seems a bit too good to be true. On his side is the pictures he has, the fact he's willing to let me open the box and packaging, the fact that he has tons of positive reviews on kijiji (and very few negative ones about things like negotiation, which makes his reviews seem authentic), and that on his account he's selling a bunch of different gaming and electronic products, and his account is 2 years old and he's shown me a screenshot of an order confirmation for the bundle he's selling (so I can get warranty on the product in question), and that he wants to meet me in person and apparently has a very nice Mercedes (not too relevant but it adds to the fact that he seems like a well to do guy).

Only problem is I look at ebay and stockx and most ps5s are going for 950-1100 even without an extra controller (though some have horizon forbidden west bundled). 

Is this guy a scammer? Is he going to sell me a box of bricks or a bricked ps5?"

1,"I Miss the Old Era of Game Conferences  I feel like since COVID (and a few years before tbh) gaming presentations have felt so dry and stale. Whether its a State of Play, Summer Games Fest, The Game Awards, or even the Xbox Bethesda Showcase, I feel as if these have lost the magic they used to have. Obviously the pandemic has played a role, but the days of live audience reactions to a surprise announcement during E3 seem to be over and that makes me sad. For example, I think Sony's E3 2016 press conference is probably the all-time best gaming showcase/conference/show ever. It completely exceeded anyone's expectations, there were very few leaks, the theatricality of the show itself with the orchestra going into a LIVE 15 minute demo of God of War (2 years before it even came out!!). Could you imagine a showcase now showing a live 15 minute demo of a game 2 years before release now?? Not to mention the other great moments, like an exclusive Spider-Man game, the reveal of Resident Evil 7 being a first person survival horror game that no one knew was The Kitchen demo months before, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, Crash Bandicoot coming back, giving a date for The Last Guardian, Kojima literally walking out on stage and showing Death Stranding for the first time before anyone knew what it was. Bottom line, this conference was just full of surprises and amazing moments and I just don't think something like this will ever happen again, especially now with everyone doing direct-style formats for their presentations. Maybe it's just me but I've always enjoyed the live shows with an audience much more than these dry, corporate directs that everyone does now."
1,"PSN Store Sales Tax Within EU I am currently living in Portugal, within the European Union. And my account is set to my country. Although every time I buy something from the psn store, the statement says it came from the PSN London. This makes it so that I have to pay a sales tax over the cost of the game. 

I haven't owned a Playstation console in years and this is new to me. But I'm pretty sure I didn't set the region to the UK. I actually double checked it to be sure. My account is registered in the country I'm living in. 

Is there something I possibly missed?"

My original white controller that came with the console doesn't have any issues at all.

Tempted to return both of them but before I do, is this now normal? Not impressed with the build quality at all."

1,"Struggling to charge controller? Anyone else found difficulties with this? I prefer to charge my controller from a wall socket after I finish playing. The voltage of the power brick is correct with a suitable usb-C cable that charges phones/switch etc. and when I plug it in it pulses orange, but it doesn't charge any more than when it was last used and the orange light lasts indefinitely (as opposed to turning off when fully charged). This is the same when the console is fully off, and when it's in rest mode. I've used multiple bricks and cables with the same result.

I can charge the controller when I'm playing, but only by turning it off, plugging it in, then turning it back on. This is the only way to get it to hold charge. I can also charge it via the USB on the console when it's in rest mode, but it's tricky to get the console so I prefer not to do this.

Anyone else had similar issues and found a solution? Never had any problem charging the ps4 controller from a wall socket, it's causing some issues not being able to do it with the ps5 as I don't sit near a plug or USB socket when I'm playing.

Cheers!"

I have done quite a bit of research over the past week regarding the Scuff Reflex pro or The Hex gaming controller. 

So, I'm not a hardcore FPS player which is why I didn't not include the Scuff FPS Pro. I play a mixed bag of games thus I want something that will give me a little more responsiveness than the standard PS5 controller.

If you could please just give me your vote and your 1 favorite reason why I would greatly appreciate it Reddit family.

1,"Bummed you can't broadcast ""stream"" games So my wife and I run a theme park YouTube channel - we focus mostly on Disney here in Southern California, but we also do the other local theme parks including Universal. We'd been kicking around the idea of doing some live streams playing games, as our current live stream base was interested in it. We'd been thinking about starting with the LEGO Skywalker Saga since it falls into our normal fan base. 

I had some new ideas today though with the release of the new tiers of PS Plus. I subscribed to the highest tier to check it out and noticed there were a lot of older PS3 era Disney games that could be fun to go back and mess around with on a live stream. I tried to do a test stream of Toy Story Mania only to find that since it's a stream game (no download option since PS5 can't emulate PS3 games) that you can't actual broadcast it using the built in PS5 hardware/software. I'm sure some of you already knew this - but it was news to me who was just trying it. 

It's not the end of the world, but being able to do it built in would have been nice, rather than going with a capture card and all that fun stuff."

Now, all the new PS exclusives are sequels. God of War 2, Horizon Zero Dawn 2, etc.

Now that Bethesda reveals Starfield, I think its time for Sony to announce a big new Playstation IP again.

Looking back on the last PS and Xbox Showcase, the biggest Playstation announcements were Final Fantasy 16 (multiplatform) and Resident Evil 4 Remake (Multiplatform). I feel like there is definitely more talk about Starfield right now.

Anyway point being if you‚Äôre curious about how some older stuff looks and plays see if you can download them and try for yourself!

Also have they stated if the games in the Extra membership rotate out?"

Would much appreciate it"

Looks like when they said ""Existing PlayStation Now members will transition to PlayStation Plus Premium, with no increase to their current subscription fees at launch"" they weren't lying. According to the website, your tier only decreases if you manually change it.

Today I got the email saying the new PS plus format was out, and noticed a ‚Äúnext payment‚Äù date in there.

1,"Has anyone figured out the upgrade pricing yet? I thought it was cut and dry - the difference in price between tiers based on your sub duration - but it appears to be much cheaper for me. I have PS+ stacked through 03/2027 and assumed that I would have to pay roughly $60 for each year on my subscription ($60 is the price difference between a year of Essential &amp; a year of Premium). 

Since I have 4.7 years of basic, I thought I would be looking at roughly $282 to upgrade. When I navigated to the upgrade tab, however, it shows $150. See here: https://i.imgur.com/COGwPdL.jpg

Does it just cap out at $150 past a certain point? If so, should we all be scrambling to find more PS+ cards, or does it not work like that? I thought the upgrade pricing was pretty clear from past emails, but I guess not"

For those that don't know, it's an FPS similar to Doom but you have to shoot, reload and do other actions based on the rhythm of the background music. It's extremely satisfying once you get a perfect combo going and the vocals kick in, the gameplay is super tight.

This would be a perfect game for VR as well, hopefully they are planning a PSVR2 version down the road.

I highly suggest you try this demo if you like rhythm based games üí™"

Has anyone tested it to see how it works now?"
1,"So, is there a way to buy a year of PS Premium if you already have Essential? I still have like half a month of Essential (AKA normal PS Plus) left on my account. When I had a bit more free money last month i put some money in my PS wallet in anticipation of getting Premium for a year at $120.

But now that it's out my only option is to pay $4.07 for the upgrade for the remaining 15 days and then be charged $50 every 3 months. But that sucks. That means a year of premium that was would be $200.

Is there any possible way I can just buy the full 12 months for $120 as advertised. I see no option whatsoever to do this."

We both have signed into each other‚Äôs PS5 and enabled console sharing. This allowed us to purchase games on each other‚Äôs PSN account, download them to our console, and play them using our own account. We could basically split the cost of a digital game and both have access to it at the same time. I just purchased PlayStation Plus Premium on my account.

1,"3rd party controller recommendations? So I recently purchased a PS5 controller to use on my PS3 as it is to common knowledge now that the PS3 is ridiculously uncomfortable however I'm still finding that the PS5 controller still give me pain in my right hand wrist after only half an hour of game play, does anyone have any 3rd party recommendations for people with big hands?"
1,"I got a PS5 directly from Sony that came defective. I had to send it back and they cannot replace it. Here are my thoughts about it. I got selected to buy a PS5. It came defective and I spent my whole weekend over the phone with Sony support to try and troubleshoot it, and hours on forums and watching YouTube videos to fix it. I legit had to **return** my PS5 and they couldn‚Äôt promise a replacement. I‚Äôm heartbroken, but here are my thoughts about the current generation consoles:

I became a PlayStation ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù when I got my PS4 Pro over the Xbox One X. Before that I only had Nintendo consoles. I grew up with the GameCube.

The reason I got a PS4 instead of an Xbox was because of the quality and exclusive games it had, the large user base, and Sony‚Äôs pro-consumer practices. Xbox One X barely had any notable exclusives and Microsoft was anti-gamer when the Xbox One first released. They had Halo, Forza, and Minecraft. Sony had God of War, Horizon, Spider-Man, The Last of Us, Uncharted, and more.

Now, the Xbox Series X is more powerful and has more memory than the PS5 at the same price. Microsoft went haywire with acquisitions and now boasts Starfield, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, DOOM, and more. The Xbox Series X also looks much better than the PS5, in my opinion. Microsoft has finally become pro-gamer once again but it seems like it‚Äôll probably dominate the gaming market in the long term. Microsoft vastly overpowers Sony.

So I‚Äôm stuck here, deciding whether or not I should get an Xbox Series X or a PS5. I want a 1 terabyte PS5 that isn‚Äôt massive it takes up a quarter of my TV stand. I‚Äôll also probably get it just to play God of War; but then again, most of these games are releasing on PC anyway."
1,"What's a Category/Genre that's missing in Sony's Single Player Narrative Games? God I really need a MGS/Splinter Cell Tactical-Espionage stealth game made by a Playstation Studio. Maybe from Santa Monica Studios or Sucker Punch. Are there any single-player genres that you think we need?   


Maybe a Midnight Club open world racing story-game focused on street races and violence? I also wouldn't mind a badass undercover cop game similar to Sleeping Dogs and a futuristic open world game that's even more futuristic than CyberPunk with flying cars and etc similar to Fifth Element.   


What would you like to see?"
1,Elden Ring Update 1.05 Patch Notes  
1,"Recommended games for a someone known for not finishing games (Including backwards compatible)? So I have my PS5 for like 8 months now. So far I have played alot of FIFA, uncharted 1-3 and TLOU1. 

I have tried GOW and Uncharted 4 but somehow these didn‚Äôt stick with me and I have never finished them. 

Including the PS3/PS4 I haven‚Äôt finished alot of games. The ones I can think of are uncharted 1-3, AC2-revelations, TLOU1, GTA IV.

I like to get my moneys worth out of a game, so $60 for a 10h games just seems expensive for me. But when I play a 100h+ open world game I just get overwhelmed. I love a good world and an emotional roller coaster. Thats why I loved TLOU1. 

Including the PS4 games it looks like RDR2 would fit my needs but the open world scares me. TLOU1 is so nostalgic to me the mixed reviews of TLOU2 scare me. Elden Ring looks dope but I disliked the fighting mechanics in GOW (while I loved the world). 

This is starting to feel like a rant but I really want to gey away from the grindy FIFA/COD hours and wanna get invested in good story games but I dont know where to start üòÇ"
1,"Judging by Microsofts game showcase Sony is spot on about subscription model ruining quality of games Microsoft and Bethesdas showcase to put it blunt was a disaster.  This was the time for Microsoft to show what spending billions got them and it was a huge disappointment.  Starfield looks good but I won't believe anything Todd Howard says anymore.  

What became clear is going all in on Gamepass has hurt the quality for Microsoft. No big announcements and big heavy hitting games anymore. It's all just Meh. This is why I dread Sony eventually putting everything on PS Plus new revision.  

Sony stick to your word and keep big quality exclusives off subscriptions."

1,"PS5 VRR on Samsung QN90A - Color slightly off? Hello Reddit,

I recently got the PS5 and Samsung's QN90A. My tv supports HDMI 2.1 (4K 120FPS) and with one of the PS5‚Äôs latest updates, VRR on said PS5. However, and maybe I‚Äôm just crazy, I‚Äôve noticed that there is a slight change in color (or brightness?) when VRR is on vs off, and I‚Äôm not even talking about when you set it to 4K 120FPS VRR, which sets the color from RGB to YUV422.

A good example would be Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. When VRR is turned off (Just 4K, RGB, 60FPS, &amp; HDR), the color really pops. His orange fur is really vibrant, and the shadow detail is really good. However, when I turn VRR on, the colors seem a bit subdued. Like Ratchet‚Äôs fur isn‚Äôt as vibrantly orange as it is when the VRR is off, and the shadows seem less dark. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but there is a definite, if slight, difference in the colors/shadows/(brightness?) when VRR is turned on or off while playing Ratchet and Clank, and even AstroBoy.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is this the nature of PS5 VRR or is there a setting I need to change on my TV or some third option?

Also, kind of related, can you see a difference between RGB and YUV422?"

1,"Better Experience?: PS5 Remote Play on PS4 Pro vs PS4 Versions of Elden Ring &amp; Horizon Forbidden West I apologize if this has been asked before, but I was curious what the better experience would be in this situation. I just got a PS5 with Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West (PS5 Versions). While my wife hogs the TV with the PS5, I moved the PS4 Pro into the other room. I recently started using the ""Remote Play"" feature, and have been controlling the PS5 via the PS4 Pro in the other room on the same network. Everything seems to be great so far. I also notice I have free download of the PS4 versions of the same games, so I figured I would install to see if there's any difference. Would the experience be better or worse to play the PS4 versions instead of doing remote play? I realize the PS4 Remote Play is being streamed wireless over the network, so there could be some type of input lag or something like that. Curious to get your opinions. Thanks!"

1,Ark Survival Evolved Fjordur New Creatures &amp; Level Details (Free DLC Now Out)  
1,"Why are there exclusive titles? I never understood this. And it seems like PS is the last platform to have exclusives (besides PC due to console limitations). Personally, I don't even really understand the point of gaming consoles anymore. To me, it seems like their time would be better spent developing gaming PCs with their own operating systems. It's not like the price is that far off anymore. Consoles are a very outdated idea and I think if they were smart, they would move on to another idea after this generation of consoles. Microsoft seems to be moving toward this direction as they implement their xbox game pass for PC. I'm not seeing Sony do much with PCs. Why are they still all in on console when a PC can play games the same as a console, while having all the other features of a computer.

But either way, having exclusive titles seems a little weird in this day, with so many other platforms and more and more people owning a PC than ever before, it just doesn't make any sense. Why would a developer choose to leave out everyone who doesn't use a PS5? Why are they leaving them out when other triple AAA developers are letting people use whatever platform they want to use. In fact, I can now play steam games and xbox game pass games using my phone and a bluetooth controller wherever I go. Sony is the only one that is stubbornly sticking to console and still accepting exclusives.

P.S. I can't wait to see the downvotes from all the people who can't have a discussion without losing control of their emotions and getting angry when someone has a different opinion. Show me how much of reddit you have plagued."

Are there any controllers out there for the PS5 that could be used with one hand and have larger buttons? And what games would you suggest would be good to get him going again!

1,"[USA]K2/Sony are blocking The Quarry PS4 Standard version in the US for those who shop outside of the PS4's console storefront. **EDIT:** **I console share with my roommate/brother who has my old OG PS4 after I got my Pro version but now I switched over to the PS5. This is how I ended up in down a rabbit hole.**

After doing research with friends in the EU, US and UAE, K2 and/or Sony has (purposely?) blocked US players the ability to purchase the PS4's Standard Edition IF you're not actively searching/buying on the PS4 console's actual environment/storefront. Buying the Standard PS4 edition while on the PS5 is not possible UNLESS you get the DELUXE. 

Before the launch, you could have per-ordered the PS4 Standard port while on your PS5 and you could also leave it in your cart. After launch, the game was removed  from my cart.

Pretty much you have to be on your PS4 to be able to purchase the PS4 Standard Edition port. Outside of this, if you try to buy it via the PS5 console's storefront, the web, mobile or the mobile app, you cannot find it OR you get rerouted to a black screen with "" Not available for purchase"" if you follow links from the game's official site.

Example here: [https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI](https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI)

In the EU, you're able to buy the port while on the PSN storefront from the web/app (and I am guessing the PS5 too?) with out issues:[https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv](https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv) 

Xbox does not seem to have the same ""issues"" at all, here: [https://imgur.com/gVud3Px](https://imgur.com/gVud3Px)

When you're on PSN's page and you're searching for The Quarry on a browser, the tab renames itself to 'Access Denied' when the search results pop up regardless if you're logged in or not. [https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU](https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU) 

While cruising through these 6 pages, all that does come up are the DLC, the PS5 port and the Deluxe PS4/PS5 port bundle only.

From what I was told on our Discord, the UAE is having the exact same issues. Keep in mind that I cannot 100% back up this claim as I have not been able to properly investigate it. 

Does ANYONE know why this would happen, if it's intentional or not. I am guessing IF it is by design, it has to be on Sony's end as Xbox does not have the same thing going on."

Has Sony done anything to address this issue in the past couple months? I just wanna buy a new controller and not worry about the drift and possibly just keep this one to work on."

1,"Mute Button on Controller So i assume that many people, if not the majority, prefer to mute the controller via the mute button at all times. When mutet, the button lights up, which does look kind of silly when you mainly play that way.

I wonder why you wouldn't switch the lighting up, so the mute button lights up when you're unmuted? That way it shows you when others can hear you, and the light switches off when you're muted

Hopefully Sony will enable to change this in the settings one day ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

The Getaway.

It's been almost 20 years, it's time.

Sony, give Team Soho the Lazarus treatment, and get The Getaway on our consoles post haste.

My understanding is that in general with external drives and my PS5 I can:
1. Move PS5 games there rather than deleting them and then it would be quicker to move them back than it would be to reinstall
2. Move PS4 games to the drive and play them directly.  

Will this hard drive allow me to do those two things?"

Are they actually going with the you‚Äôll find out after you subscribe method?"
1,"TLoU2 on PC, and PS5 patch? So from the announcement of TLoU remake, I make two extrapolations. Neil D says the remake has support for dualsense haptic feedback, and is built for ps5, which I suppose means amongst other things loading in a couple of seconds.

Tlou2 does not do that. The remake is built on the same engine as 2, so that should mean that the 2 probably could get a patch soon-ish with ps5-short load times and haptic feedback. Today, 2 is ps5 only in the sense that it has framerate unlocked as it is running in ps4 pro-mode (I assume).

And since the remake is on its way to pc, I guess that work also enables 2 to hit pc at a time that is more set by marketing and business decisions rather than technical limitations."

1,"Recommended Games for 1st Time PlayStation Owner? Hey everyone! I'm a first time PlayStation owner. I'm looking for game recommendations.

A bit about me. I've always been a Nintendo player. I go for games that are cutesy (Kirby, Pokemon), challenging (Metroid Dread, Hades), and have a unique art style or are just praised and stand out in a way (Inside, Short Hike, Journey, Shadow of the Colossus). I don't usually go for games that have this realistic, gray atmosphere to them and things like Destiny, Call of Duty, or sports games really interest me.

The games I have now are Elden Ring, the 2 Spiderman games, and No Man's Sky. I bought the PS5 for Elden Ring. I'm really into the game's open world and world building. It's one of those cases where the game is just so good I don't mind the more grim, realistic art style. I will say I do take breaks from it cus of how intense it is. I love Spiderman for the traversal. I'm interested in No Man's Sky exploration. I was overwhelmed by it at first though because it was my first game on the PS5 while trying figure out the interface I was also trying to figure out the PS5 controller.

I'm interested in the Talos Principle but I can just borrow it from a friend. Gonna get Shadow of the Colossus at some point. I would get The Last of Us but I never thought I'd ever get a PlayStation so spoiled it for myself by reading it online. I also really enjoyed Astro's Playroom.

If you have any recommendations for me, let me know! I'm excited to join this community!"

I wish there was a way to apply pressure to Sony to actually fix this. 

The really irritating thing is that as the second failure was out of warranty period, I have to pay for a new controller but there is only three months warranty from the PS repair clinic. 

This means that I will have paid for 2 expensive controllers.. and likely it will break again in a few months and then I will not have a working controller again!"

1,"""video games are problematic"" I don't wanna hear about how video games are problematic from people who watch dating reality shows and have a million media consuming habits that I could nitpick at for being mindless or promoting the values of  the elites or promoting a white male perspective or whatever the fuck else you could complain about ANY fucking piece of media or art made ever in any Western country since forever ago.

I love applying critical theories to media and thoughtful analyses of problematic BS in games and movies and all media, and I do find a lot of things problematic in the media I consume (inappropriate accents and racial stereotypes in games KILL ME for example) but if you don't play a game and think it's problematic immediately upon hearing it's basic premise or plot, you're a pretentious faux-intellectual asshat is all you are.

In this particular situation this person who watches dating reality shows (UMM PROBLEMATIC FOR PROMOTING AN EXCLUSIVELY MONOGAMOUS POV?) and all sorts of shit that I would never bother with accused me of buying into pro war propaganda by playing Fallout games without ever playing any of them for even a second, and I'm just like wow no wonder everyone sees you as a downer and no one likes you.

What the fuck kinda way is that to respond to someone talking about a game or book or movie ""oh sooo problematic"" when your own diet of media consists of trash like Love Island.

Fuck the haters, and enjoy your games, I just wanted to vent, maybe others can relate?

Why do people do this pretentious critic bullshit with shit they know nothing about; I don't see how it's rewarding behavior (what benefits are there besides feeling special???) in any way but what the fuck do I know...."

Yesterday I stayed home from work the entire day waiting for fedex to deliver my PlayStation 5. I was home watching tV and I got a notification that my package was not delivered because I wasn‚Äôt home. I called FedEx immediately because I was home and I have a doorbell camera so I know for certain there was no delivery attempt made.

FedEx apologized and said they would try again tomorrow.

I waited on my front porch for the whole morning the next day. I was determined to get my package. I saw the driver pull up and turn off his truck. He clearly didn‚Äôt see me because he didn‚Äôt look, and then started his truck to drive off. I quickly ran to the truck and called him out asking for my package. After about 10 mins of him saying my package was on a different truck I insisted he checked and he ‚Äúfound‚Äù my package in his truck.

The insistence that he didn‚Äôt have my package in my opinion was most likely him hoping I wouldn‚Äôt challenge him so he could make away with my ps5. Walmart stupidly labeled the outside of the box with a ps5 logo so of course he knew what was in the box. 

I can‚Äôt think of any other reason that he would park outside my house and not deliver a package than to steal it and make it look like delivery was attempted.

https://i.redd.it/yr94nqhhqqr51.jpg

Appreciate a flat design might impede airflow as there would be no direct under channel of air the rear and any design would need sufficient venting to compensate for this making them a little uglier than they would be anyway. But for those that have the console horizontal flat plates would be crazy useful. If they were black the console would be pretty much camouflaged anyway.

That's not my question though.

So the brief history is that the original Bladestorm: Hundred Years War was release in 2007. Then in 2015 the Nightmare version (a remake with a new mode, but also graphic/gameplay enhancements I think) was released on ps4, xbox, pc.  

If you look up reviews of Nightmare you'll see shiny updated graphics and the new Fantasy mode. 

When you play/stream the PS Now version of Bladestorm: Nightmare; I'm like 99% sure it's the dated 2007 Hundred Years War version. This is both odd and frustrating, because the title card clearly states ""Nightmare"". 

Okay if that wasn't odd enough, apparently this PS Now version, purportedly released in 2015, \*\*does\*\* have the new fantasy mode.

1,"LG OLED C1 and PS5 HDR - HGIG VS DYNAMIC TONE MAPPING Hello guys,

After doing one of the best things in life (getting a 77 inch LG OLED C1) , i managed to get my hands also on a ps5. So currently i am trying to find the best settings for the HDR and i came to these recommendations :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve\_been\_doing\_ps5\_adjust\_hdr\_wrong\_heres\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve_been_doing_ps5_adjust_hdr_wrong_heres_how/)

and on this

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the\_definitive\_guide\_to\_setting\_up\_your\_tv\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the_definitive_guide_to_setting_up_your_tv_for/)

Based on Vincents guide and with having in mind that your TV supports HGIG.

I know also many people swear by HGIG over Dynamic Tone Mapping HDR but the truth is that some games like Assasins Creeds Origins still look more colorful and vibrant on the Dynamic Tone Mapping (at least when i tested in on my old ps4 pro) HDR instead of the HGIG option.

So setting up my HDR on my ps5 based on these recommendations above would make HGIG also brighter and more colorful on games like Assasins Creeds Origins or i should changing to DTM for such games?

If so the ps5 hdr setting should be remain the same or adjust them accordingly?

Btw i had the impression also that the ps4 pro HDR was a bit more Vibrant than the PS5...though it might my idea but i'd like to hear your opinions on too that!"

I‚Äôm not a fan of Battle Royale but I really liked TLOU Multiplayer and it was basically mini Battle Royale. With Naughty Dog polish they could have a mega hit multiplayer if they would have a Battle Royale mode with infected scattered around the map. 

I‚Äôm picturing Teams showing up all over the map in trucks to enter the map and start to scavenge for supplies like single player and factions. What would set this apart however is infected of all kinds scattered around and you would have to be quiet and not alert them. Or maybe set traps for other Teams. With the games setting the options are endless. I think it would be amazing honestly. The basics are already in TLOU 1 they just expand the map and add more players and infected. 

And not saying this would be only mode of course have factions also. 

Only thing is the map shrinking mechanic not sure what it could be"

Hi, I'm worried about an issue that has happened 2 or 3 times now to me, which is my PS5 turning itself off randomly when it's just sitting turned on, but not in heavy use, like just sitting idly while downloading one of my games or nothing really going on but sitting at home screen.

And it's the bad type of turning off, where it's not going into rest mode, but it's turning all the way off and when I turn it on again it goes through the database or whatever scan and then says my PS5 was improperly turned off.

I really don't think (and/or hope) it's an overheating issue, but I'm not sure of other reasons it could be happening, and/or what to do if this continues.

I want to be able to take advantage of HDR to it's fullest so if I play GoW (or any game for that matter) @ 4K 60fps, does that mean I won't be in HDR mode? My TV does say it's in HDR mode though.

Question I have is, am I still in 10bit HDR if I do game at 4K 60fps 4:4:2/4:4:0? Or does it go down to 8bit? If so, is 8bit still considered HDR? Or am I way off in my understanding?

Lastly, does playing in 4K 30fps allow it to be 4:4:4 10bit? My assumption is yes. So the last question I have is there a perceptible difference in color and HDR quality for 4:4:4 vs 4:4:2/4:4:0? In other words, does playing in 30fps vs 60fps warrant the color degradation?"

1,Everything announced during Summer Game Fest 2022  
1,"The Quarry - PS4 v PS5 The Quarry releases tomorrow on all platforms. But one thing that‚Äôs been somewhat holding me back from preordering is the $70 price point for the PS5 version. 

Now I know this is gonna be the new price point for most PS5 games but seeing that PS4 is $10 cheaper and available for purchase on the PS5. Would you recommend getting that version instead? Do you think there‚Äôll noticeably be a difference??  

Which version are you guys getting?"
1,"PS5 Coil whinnying From about two weeks ago I got my hands on a new ps5, I really enjoyed it till I starting playing demanding games like Riftapart or even fifa and I notices the coil whinnying sound. i cant truely enjoy my ps5 since it was marketed as a silent console and I was a previous ps4 user, and the feeling of having a faulty ps5 is running the fun. Some people say that the sound is normal but I cant get over it and returning the console feels like pain since the place is a 3 hour drive from my location, I dont know what to do."

1,"Flickering/pixelated shadows in all games on ps5 I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else experiences this-In most games I have played on my ps5, outdoor shadows flicker hectically and look pixelated. I‚Äôve noticed it happens most with shadows made by the sun where foliage or people are moving, which has proved to affect the majority of environments I experience and can be very distracting. This includes elden ring, tlou2, cyberpunk, ghost of Tsushima, now AC origins and more. Just wondering if this is common?"
1,PS5 Reinstallation File I was playing online on my PS5 when my wifi cut out. Now I need to do a hard reset and it‚Äôs telling me to install the corresponding reinstallation file from the playstation website. I‚Äôm trying to do so now but could only find a 1 GB USB drive when thr update is 1.1 GB. Does anybody know if it will still work if I compress the file or any other solutions?

1,"Tell about your battle station and I'll make a nice infographic about our setups here! Hey Folks,

As the title suggests, the idea here is to get to know what gear does your workstation have, how and when do you use it. Provided there is enough survey entries (at least 100) I will make a hopefully cool infographic in which you will see what fellow r/buildapc users have in their setup. How many of us use monitor light? How many of us use VESA mount/ arm? What is on your desk? Individually they are small questions but could create a cool r/dataisbeautiful style infographic :)

I made a 5 min, anonymous, survey. Feel free to skip any question you don't want to tackle, there are no mandatory questions. Even one vote helps:)

[Take the survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/6LNVKPL)

I had to use survey monkey as reddit support only 6 vote options at a time......"

1,"PSA: if you live in an area where electric outages are common, PS5 requires sine wave UPS, not a simulated sine wave one... There's not enough coverage on this since it's not common for people to have blackouts, but i live in an area that have multiple power outages daily.

I bought my ps5 recently, I've had a UPS that i used for my ps4 pro, it worked fine so i just hooked my ps5 to it. It worked fine for the most part. I didn't have a problem playing ps4 games on ps5, the ps5 didn't shut down on power outages or anything, it was great. But everything went bad when i started playing native ps5 games. Anytime i had a ps5 game open (the two examples I tested were next gen cyberpunk and the matrix experience) the console would always crash during electric outages 100% of the time. The problem seems to be the fact that the transfer time from regular power to battery is too long for ps5 to handle specifically when playing next gen titles.


I tested multiple different UPS with different capacities, any of them that had simulated sine wave signal didn't work. The only thing one that worked was a UPS that uses real sine wave signal without any transfer time to battery. This was further confirmed by my friend who lives in the same area and has a ps5 with a simulated sine wave signal as well.

Tl;dr for anyone dealing with this as well since there isn't enough coverage, a simulated sign wave UPS isn't good enough, you will need a sine wave UPS to use your console."

1,"Any games that actually run 120fps? Hey everyone, I've had my PS5 for about 3 months now. I was wondering which games are actually gonna run at 120fps? 

I've got a decent number of games now, and the only one that will run 120fps is Spiderman, and it was an update that just came out a few weeks ago. 

Aside from this no games run at 120, everything is 60fps with low resolution mode. Kind of disappointing, don't y'all think? 

My games: 
Jedi Fallen Order
Resident Evil: Village
Spiderman (+miles morales)
Rocket League
NHL 22
Assassin's Creed Valhalla
(And a few horror games)

I just find it surprising none of these can do 120. 

Which games have 120fps support? Looking to get the most out of my LG OLED and PS5."

1,"PS5 Not Finding Networks I've had a PS5 since Xmas and so far I haven't had any issues with it. The other day, however, I started having issues with it being able to find networks. I've tried every solution I found online and none of them have been helpful so far. Turning off the PS5 lets me use the internet for a short period of time, but so far every time, ranging from a few hours to the better part of a day so far, it eventually goes back down. I am pretty sure at this point that the issue is the wifi card on the PS5 itself because it won't detect any networks, not even my phone hotspot despite it being right next to it, but I don't know what to do to fix that. Are there any replacements I can get for it? Any other recommendations that don't include all the usual basic stuff I keep getting? I've tried literally everything I can think of, every solution I've found online that seemed plausible."

1,Why are my graphics are trash So I‚Äôve got a ps5 obviously with a bush 4k tv however for some reason my graphics just look awful. The colours are kind off the screen is kind of blurry and when I play horror games its way to dark I try playing around with the gamma in the games but when I make it bright enough just to see it makes my game look crap. I‚Äôve tried to look online and I‚Äôve done some of the things people are saying to do but my graphics still just look trash. Idk if it‚Äôs the tv or the ps5 that is messing my graphics does anyone have a suggestion of how to fix this
1,"The gaming industry has changed The gaming industry has come a long way in my lifetime. Going from 2D to 3D. Offline play to online. Now virtual reality. As much as these achievements are great. Much sinister things lurk. 
Buying a game before meant you bought the game. End of. Now I agree that updates are great to iron out any deficiencies. But now days the games that get released are broken. At least most of them are. The GTA trilogy. Every fifa. COD. Battlefield. It seems that getting a game out on deadline day is priority. No matter it‚Äôs condition. And some get even more broken as the year goes on. Money is the driving factor. Get it out. Make profit. Then try fixing it. Games are bait now days. Getting the best achievements came from grind and hard work. But now they dangle the best achievements in front of you for the small price of half a pint (¬£2.50). This is their market. And everyone is falling for it. It defeats the object of actually playing the game. Take GT sport for example. Yes you‚Äôd have to put some hours in to get the best cars. But it was doable. GT7 has now made that almost impossible. You‚Äôd have to put in 40 hours just to get one car. But you can have that car now if you pay a small price. The gaming world in my opinion is in its worst place. Games that used to compete against each other to out sell one another. Now it‚Äôs just make a few things up. Get a fancy promo video done for it. And what doesn‚Äôt work. We‚Äôll try and fix later. The passion has gone. Corporation ruining the experience as it taps up little kids to spend all their birthday money on the best stuff. After already paying ¬£70 for the game."

1,"what is the ideal release schedule for big games? would you rather have a new game every few months or a strong summer/holiday season with several games at once? summer and holidays used to be the best time of the year and i prefer the second option: an avalanche of great games to tempt me to spend a lot of money at once

i remember christmas time in 2001 or 2004 where a lot of incredible games released at the same time

when PS2 got GTAIII, FFX, MGS2 and DMC all ""at the same time"" and when GC and XBOX were just releasing made a huge competitive difference and set the pace of the generation

same with GTASA, HL2, DQVIII, MGS3, GT4 etc.

that kind of scenario set my mind as regards when to expect the best games - now it feels weird if an important game gets released in for example february which used to be a very weak month

and recently maybe christmas isnt just that big of a deal?

would i have cared more about HFW if it had released in december?

i hope GOWR is announced for november - it would be great to have something to look forward to this year"

While understandably the graphics quality is much different than DS, Im having constant textures pop in issues. After a little digging, I can see the PS4 version was recommended over the PS5 version for better performance. 

Is it still the case? Or this was patched? I might trade in my ps5 version and swap it with the PS4 disc.

1,"Can Sony get rid of the update ""copying"" already? Is this really absolutely necessary? This seems like a last gen holdover that's really holding this console back. The latest Horizon patch took minutes to download and almost half an hour to copy. 

I've never had to recopy an entire game on PC for example after an update and have never had a game corrupt because of not doing it, so this reasoning they use doesn't really hold up."
1,"Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Insomniac and Sucker Punch are all working on unannounced multiplayer games. Let's speculate what they might be. I think Naughty Dogs is highly rumored to be working on a follow up to Last of Us: Multiplayer, which was an absolute blast to play. And I'm very excited about that. 

The other ones are all anyone's guess. 

Sequels to Killzone and Resistance would be cool. But part of me wants to see franchises like Socom and Syphon Filter make a comeback on current gen. And also would love to see brand new multiplayer franchises born under these great developers."

1,"Series X owner that just bought a PS5! I have an expansive Xbox library and I mostly bought my PS5 for exclusives and  will use my Xbox for multiplayer. Sometimes I do want to play my third party games that I have on Xbox on my PS5 such as COD, Destiny 2, Madden, NBA 2k etc‚Ä¶. (I know some of the games I mentioned are in their game passes but I‚Äôm just using examples) My actual question is would I need to rebuy the actual game themselves including their expansions in the PS5 store? I wanna take advantage of the days of play sale right now. 

Thanks!"

Is there a fix for this? I‚Äôve never experienced this on ps4. I‚Äôm also plugged up to the ethernet cable.

1,"PS5 Dyling Light 2 echoing/reverb audio I have a quick question for the community, I just got dying light 2 for the ps5 and every bit of audio sounds like its coming from someone at the end of a tunnel.  If I'm directly in front of someone, they sound fine.  But if I look away even a few degrees they get this really heavy echoing reverb effect.  I looked at all my reciever connections, ps5 settings, and in game settings and I'm pretty damn sure it isn't me.  Plus, the fact that it's only when I turn away from the source of the audio is when it kicks in makes me think is purposeful.  Some weird attempt at surround sound maybe?  But it sounds so awful there's no way right?  It kinda sounds like how in a souls game if you start to walk away from someone talking you get an echoey effect because youre hearing them in your head (or at least that's the effect I always figured they were going for).  But it makes zero sense in this setting, and when there are 10 npcs all standing and chatting in different parts of the room is disorienting as all hell.  And again, sounds just awful.  Is this how it's supposed to sound?  Or do I need to play with my settings/connections more?  If so, any reccomendations?  As a FYI I've not had this issue with any other game currently on my ps5."
1,"There should be a Toggle for Custom Buttons Assignments in the Accessibility Menu http://imgur.com/a/2XXvWED

As someone who uses this feature in a few different games, its quite annoying to go into the Accessibility Settings every time I switch games, when it could just be in the quick menu like it was on PS4.

Also while we are at it:
- It would be nice if we could save different profiles for different games, so we don't have to reset and reasign the buttons when switching games

- There should be a checkbox to toggle whether the custom assignments should be active globally or only in games"

1,"PS5 Turning Off From Rest Mode I‚Äôm not sure if this is a common issue or not, but my PS5 is having issues turning on from Rest Mode. I have my PS5‚Äôs SIMPLINK setup in settings and the same for SIMPLINK on my LG C1. My PS5 is also always in Rest Mode and I‚Äôve never had issues with it before until recently. However, when I try to turn on my PS5 (from Rest Mode) with my DualSense by either tapping or holding the PS home button on the controller, the PS5 turns on simultaneously with the TV but once the display for the TV turns on, the PS5 automatically cycles back into Rest Mode‚Ä¶from Rest Mode.

I‚Äôve shut down and unplugged the PS5 entirely and turned on/off SIMPLINK multiple times on both devices, and both devices are updated to their latest system software. The only thing I haven‚Äôt done is reset my PS5 because I don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily risk losing game save data if I don‚Äôt have to.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing something wrong or differently than I always have (I‚Äôm not), or if this is a software issue that can be fixed in a future update, but I‚Äôve never had issues with Rest Mode on my PS5 in the past year that I‚Äôve had it. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any solutions?"
1,"Confused between digital vs disc edition to get, I have few questions I have never used any console previously. I have so many questions. please bear with me

2. how disc games update when a new game update is released?
3. How do DLCs work in disc version? do I have to buy the DLCs digitally?
4. how save games and achievements(or trophies) work? are they tied to the disc or my user account on PS5? If if buy a disc, play the game, sell it, buy it again, do I keep my saves and trophies?
5. can I use the the blue ray player to watch blueray movies and as file storage?
6. what is the life expectancy of the discs? if I want to play a game many times in many years, should I buy it as disc or digital?

1,"HDMI 2.0b (4K 60hz HDR10): YUV422 vs Full RGB? Hello, everyone, I have sony LCD TV that supports HDMI 2.0b and can display 4K 60hz with HDR10 enabled. I am not planning on upgrading in a year or two.

What would be better for me to use HDR enabled with YUV422 standard or full RGB for my games? 

With full RGB I get some ugly red/blue lights pop up (expected but still) which doesn‚Äôt look that good although colors are more vibrant, I would even say acid-y. With HRD enabled the light contrast is much more pleasant and colors are a bit smoother/dimmer which look more pleasant to my eye but real blacks or whites are not as sharp overall.

I mostly play oldish games although I do have some ps5 compatible titles like borderlands 3 and cyberpunk.

Which option would give me the best quality overall?

P.S.: if I set HDR to auto my ps5 switches it off as default and only enables it in some games."

1,"My first impression on Allstar-Brawl (PS5) I played about 10 matches as kora (1v1) online and don't really want to keep on going even though i won every match. 

The gameplay is ok for type of game but very floaty. The roaster is ok as well as the graphics. But there is nothing really positiv to say. 

I am somehow missing the charm those characters and stages should have.

If you don't care for the character i'd rather recommend brawlhalla or wait for multiversus.

Have fun if you like it.

But yeah. Hopefully multiverse will be good."

I have a question regarding my set-up and 5.1 sound. I have the following: 

LG 50UP75006LF tv

Logitech Z906, connected via optical to the TV

PS5, connected to HDMI switch that supports 4K HDR 60HZ and supports DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, LPCM7.1, PCM, DTS, Dolby Digital AC3, DSD etc -&gt; TV 

What would be the best settings on my TV and PS5 to achieve 5.1? 

On TV: PCM, passthrough or automatic? 

On PS5: Which output mode? And should I choose Dolby, DTS or PCM?

Thanks for the help!

I know there is frequently the case where if you want to buy physical version of a game for PS5, you can either buy the PS4 version and get the free upgrade download, or just buy the PS5 disc for a straight install.

What I'm trying to find out, is what games do NOT have a PS5 disc, but have a PS4 disc that allow an upgrade?

The only two I'm aware of are Cyberpunk 2077, and PJ Masks: Heroes of the Night.  Are there any others?

It's really an amazing controller, but unfortunately using it causes chronic wrist pain for me.  I recently narrowed down my pain to the PS5 controller when I stopped playing it for a week and the pain went away, then it came back when I tried playing again.  This does not happen when I use the DS4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.

At the very least I wish Sony would let use use the DS4 controller for PS5 games.  We have the option to turn off haptics anyway, so I'm not sure why they're not allowing it other than forcing people to buy more DualSense controllers."

People complain that the story is boring, the villains are awful, it's not as mysterious as the first game, Aloy is annoying, or fat, or both.

Of course there are a lot of people that enjoy the game as well, but it's surprisingly contraversial considering how well recieved and beloved Horizon Zero Dawn was.

So what do you think? Is it a good game, or is it disappointing compared to the first one?"

So, I read online that PS4 controllers can only be used on PS4 games. When I download the game on the new PS5, how do I make sure I'm getting the PS4 version? Should I download it first on the PS4 and tranfer it to the PS5, or can I select it straight from the new console?

I downloaded the PS5 version, but since you need the disc to play the PS4 versions installs once the disc is inserted or the console starts up. Is there a way to prevent this except installing the PS4 version and loose disc space. Starting to think this is  Sonys way to annoy people who buys the PS4 versions. I now rather pay extra for PS5 disc then having to handle these kinds of hassles."

1,"I can't access the PS5 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake So I bought the PS4 version of this digitally when it came out. Not the free PS+ version. I downloaded it and it's still playing the PS4 pro version of the game. It's labeled as such too. The three dot option that asks you which version to view only has the PS4 version. On the PSN store the PS5 version says unavailable. If I go to the game it says play game. If it's uninstalled it says that it's unavailable and that I may have already downloaded the version already. The intergrade ps5 version upgrade is unavailable as well. The PS4 version of the digital deluxe version is available for $20. 

This shit is seriously considering. Any help is appreciated on how to get the PS5 version."

1,"Resident Evil 2, 3 &amp; 7 Current-Gen updates very likely happening this Thursday after Summer Games Fest I just hopped on the PS Store and found the Racoon City Edition which contains both RE2 and RE3 is on heavy sale right now (60%), but the thing that immediately stood out to me, was when the sale is ending.

""Offer ends 9/6/2022""

Literally on the same day that Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest is happening. We know that the update atleast for RE3 has already been found uploaded to the PSN backend, but people are unable to download it as you can see from the link below.

So the update is already up and ready, and the sale ends on Thursday when SGF kicks off. Seems to me like if you are interested in this for the current-gen update, then you have until Thursday to get it for cheap before it launches.

Arctis Pro I have read have some audio issues with popping and connectivity.

1,"what do you guys think about the PSVR 2?  

The first VR headset I ever owned was the PSVR, so PSVR was what introduced me to VR. I remember opening the box on Christmas 5 years ago, getting incredibly excited to try 6DoF VR for the first time. Then about 4-6 months later I got bored of VR, due to its shitty tracking solution and shitty controllers. So in 2019 I buy my first ever high-end PC, after saving up for a couple of months, and along with that, I decided to give VR another try, but on a new platform, pcvr. So I bought the Rift S because I didn't have the room size or money for an index, and I had that for about 4 more months before I got tired of it. And now, I'm using a Quest 2, which I love. And after 4 months, I'm still not tired of it. But now, seeing what the PSVR2 will be capable of, I'm getting that. Even if I end up not using my Quest 2. I can just sell that.

What excites me about it are the controllers. they look so much better than the touch controllers. The touch controllers are small and get in the way all the time when loading guns. But what excites me the most about them are the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. If it wasn't for those features, then I wouldn't have decided that I want it, months before it is even released.

Just one thing I'm worried about is the USB-C. Having to run a 4k120 signal through that is going to be tough. I didn't even know that was possible. And I do think the headset looks a bit... ugly. But I'm going to wear it anyways.

So I'm wondering what you guys think? are you going to get it? Or do you not care about it?"

So originally I was only going to get a 2tb ssd once the prices have gone down but now that the new PS+ tiers are gonna be a thing very soon and plenty of games I want to try out, I'm now thinking 2tb might not be enough in the long run and now I have my eyes on 4tb ssds but don't know which one to go with. Here are the two different ones that I'm considering:

\[Seagate FireCuba 530\]([https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr\_1\_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr_1_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1))

\[SABRENT Rocket 4 Plus\]([https://www.amazon.com/1TB-SSD-Heatsink-PS5-SB-RKT4P-PSHS-1TB/dp/B09G2P4PYP/ref=sr\_1\_4?crid=ELZ1DEZ3GTVD&amp;keywords=sabrent%2Brocket%2B4%2Bplus&amp;qid=1654443626&amp;sprefix=sabren%2Caps%2C127&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/1TB-SSD-Heatsink-PS5-SB-RKT4P-PSHS-1TB/dp/B09G2P4PYP/ref=sr_1_4?crid=ELZ1DEZ3GTVD&amp;keywords=sabrent%2Brocket%2B4%2Bplus&amp;qid=1654443626&amp;sprefix=sabren%2Caps%2C127&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1))

As you can see both are the lowest prices they have been so far according to camelcamelcamel and both come with heatsinks, one is built in and the other replace the PS5's ssd cover. I don't mind these prices because they are higher tier ssds and great for long term use. I would go with the FireCuba 530 but I don't know if there is a real advantage to replacing the ssd cover with the sabrent heatsink or is the built in heatsink more than enough, or should I mix and match and get the 530 without the heatsink and get the sabrent heatsink for it instead? Thanks in advance."

At that point, it powers up, only to take me to a screen that says it's ""Repairing Console Storage."" It lets me report the issue, then goes through the normal sequence as though nothing had happened...until it crashes again. I haven't dared play any games on it since this started, so thus far, it's done it while watching YouTube or Netflix, or just on the Home screen.

I have power cycled it, checked to make sure my system is up-to-date, switched it from a power strip to its own socket (though with the power strip still plugged in below, in case that could be the issue)...the only thing left to do that I've seen so far is to backup my save files to a flash drive, restart the console in Safe Mode, and ""Reconfigure Console Storage."" If that doesn't work, Sony wants to charge me $229 just to look at it, which is money I don't have.

Has anyone else had this issue? If so, was it ever resolved? And if so, how?

Note: I bought this console from a friend about 2.5 months ago, and although he bought it in September of 2020 (so it's very much out of warranty), he says he only played about 15 hours on it (compared to my 100 or so hours).

1,"I've had my PS5 over a week, and I just realized it's the disc edition I got my PS5 through Sony Direct about a week ago. As soon as I got through the queue, I clicked on ""PlayStation 5 Disc Edition"" and it said sold out, so I immediately bought the only other option, which was just titled ""PlayStation 5 Horizon Forbidden West Bundle"". I assumed since the disc version was sold out, the bundle must be the digital version. 

Today, I was stretching my back on the floor, and looking up from that view, I noticed the disc drive for the first time. I'm pleasantly surprised, but I can't believe I didn't notice it before."
1,"Looking for a New Display: 28""-32"" for the PS5 I've owned the PS5 for over a month now and I want to upgrade my display. Currently using an old tv mainly to game: 60"" Vizio. Outputs 1080p 60Hz.¬† 

I know that we have a long way to go before gaming at 4K 120Hz on console is possible. I decided to avoid OLED based displays because of the eventual burn in. I have a family member whose phone has an OLED panel and is experiencing burn in after 4 years of use. 

I am looking for a non curved 4K monitor between 28-32"" in size that has the ability to output 120Hz or better. Having VRR thru HDMI 2.1 is a huge plus. Having a KVM switch would be nice but not a deal breaker if not available. If HDR and built in speakers are present, great! If not, again, not a deal breaker. What I am currently deciding between (in no particular order): 

Gigabyte M28U
Gigabyte M32U
Dell G3223Q (not sure why there aren't many reviews out for this one)
Asus TUF VG289Q
Asus TUF VG28UQL1A (although a friend of mine bought one and then returned) 

Any others model reccomendations would be appreciated. I would prefer it to cost under $1,000. Considering I may also need to get speakers/sound bar."

1,"PS5 freezes often, anyone know the cause? So i‚Äôve had a PS5 for about 2 months now and i havent encountered a single error or anything of the sorts until yesterday. 

I was playing the PS5 version of Skyrim and when I tried to save the game the entire PS5 froze and I had to reboot it by pressing the power button for a long period of time.

It worked perfectly fine again so I continued as normal. Fastforward to today where again, after trying to save the game, the PS5 freezes and I have to redo the entire process.

Then I got a new TV and it sat higher on the same wall mount. Suddenly there was room to put the PS5 on top of the furniture. 

Now I'm getting the TV remounted lower because it's bad for my neck, and keeping the PS5 in the open is going to be tougher.

I searched for ""USB case fan"" and I see a bunch with USB-A plugs. I'm thinking of taping one to the back of the TV unit so it can vent some air out the holes when the PS5 is running. **Can someone confirm if the fan will** (first of all, come on, but also) **turn off when I put the PS5 to sleep?**

I personally miss having a social hub on PS3 that was separate from all other games but was a game itself to just chill, make an avatar, your own place to live, go hangout, etc. It be cool if Sony gave some attention to PS Home and made it accessible to PS5 owners; even implement Twitch in PS Home for further connectivity?

1,"Brand New DualSense Controllers Have Small Jitters I've recently bought a DualSense controller to use with my PC (As a matter of fact I wanted to test the game I developing with DualSense controller). When I saw the games UI does not act as I expected, I checked the controller with different testing tools most notably Steam's and [Gamepad Tester](https://gamepad-tester.com/) website. There I saw very small jitters from both sticks; While those jitters does not have real effect on the general gameplay still I did not expect them; I have tested a couple of other non-PS controllers and they have absolutely no jitters.

For that reason, I have the controller replaced by the retailer. To my surprise the second controller had the same kind of jitters. I've read that DualSense controllers are prone to drifts after sometime but I did not expect them from a brand new one.

Now my question is: Are all DualSense controllers have the same jitters from the beginning or I've just been unlucky with my purchases?"

My brother was able to play it for a while last month. My cousin surprised me with it when he sent it over from his place.

1. He forgot to send over the stand. It seems it's important for the air flow. He'll come over next month so should I ask him to bring it with him if he has it at home?

2. I think my Playstation is upside down. I don't think I'll be able to correct it until next month. Will it be fine if I leave it like that?

Thanks."
1,The graphical fidelity of RE Village for PS VR2 is the reason why going tethered was the right choice RE Village reaches the same levels of graphical fidelity on PS VR2 as it does on flat-screens in the latest trailer. This would not be possible without the wire (and without eye-tracked foveated rendering). To make the headset tethered was the right choice and will make high-end VR gaming more accessible and more mainstream. And a lot of people who already had a chance to try PS VR2 said they completely forgot about the wire in an instant.

Without going too much into detail the pacing was horrible in the game and the charchters were way more bland compared to the first game. The first game had all these great memorable characters like Bill, Tess, and the two brothers. While Tlou 2 had side characters like Dina, Mel, Jesse, Manny who were rather bland. As for Abby I understand her motives, but still didn't like her as a charachter. The sections with here and Lev were pretty good but felt like a worse version of Joel and Ellie.

I just bought a ps5 in Europe and, since I'm extra immunitarian, I asked for a refund of tax and I need to present my untouched ps5 to the customs in order to be verified for tax refund. Is it safe for me to travel with a new unopened ps5 going through check in luggage. I feel like it might either get stolen/lost or damaged since they throw luggages around with little love and pile them up might crush the console. Any tips on what I should do? If the risk is too high, I would rather just give up on tax refund and bring the unpacked ps5 onboard the plane with my hand luggage. Thanks in advance!"

1,"If there was one feature i wish the system had, it would be a System-wide Deadzone setting. I got my PS5 7 months ago with an extra controller, and both of them started to drift after 7 months of use on their left analog stick (its slight but it can get pretty annoying), Some games like Fortnite and COD work just fine because i can set the Dead-zone, other games that i'm currently invested in such as  Metal Gear Solid V don't have a dead-zone, so stealth gets pretty hard since you just randomly start to move, its weird how some games support it, but others don't, i feel like this is a big issue since these controllers are getting pretty notorious for drifting, and once they start drifting, well... you better hope that the game you are playing has a dead-zone setting, cuz otherwise it would start getting pretty annoying, or borderline unplayable at certain points.  


Which is why every PS5 game should have a Dead-zone setting, or better yet, a system-wide Deadzone setting, so devs don't need to bake it into the game, it would give the controllers a longer life-span and  a better reputation, instead having to go buy one for 70$ nearly every 6 months of use."

1,"PlayStation sells more than 2 as many games as others. Why do you think is Sony so successful? They sell approximately 15-18 games per console (1.8B / 120M)

Nintendo 6-8

Xbox, well they operate more with Gamepass. 

We all know that the money is in the software sales, not hardware sales. 

Why do you think is sony selling so many games? The competition has the same amount of consoles (switch, Wii had even more than the ps3))

Ps4 is the most successful console of all time. With today approximately 1.8,1.9 billion games sold (April 2021 1.6 billion)Why? Wanna know your opinion

I can't even find the new Enhanced and Expanded version on the PS store at all, which furthers my confusion.

1,"PS5 + Logitech Z906 solution? I have a PS5 and a 5.1 DTS Z906 sound system. No hdmi on it, only coax or optical...

But my TV has a hdmi arc port...

Currentlt my PS5 is plugged to the tv and the TV is plugged to the Z906 through optical. With the PS5 sound settings set to Dolby I have true directional 5.1 in games, and DTS working great on blurays, so that is the good news. It also doesn't sound compressed. That being said I am not 100% sure there is no audio channel loss with this setting.

My question is this:

I found a hdmi arc to coaxial converter on amazon. Basically I plan to leave the image transfer untouched via hdmi between the console and the tv, but extract the sound through the arc port of the TV, into the converter, then plugged to the sound system via optical or coaxial...

Does that sound like something that makes sense and would work? The goal is to have pure passthrough sound like the PS4 has when it was plugged directly through optical. Damn Sony why did you remove the optical on the PS5......"

1,"Sony-made PS2 emulator - Would you pay for it? How much? I was discussing an idea with a group of coworkers the other day and wanted to see what the consensus might be for something specific. In the group of over a dozen people, every single person said they'd be willing to pay for this. And the ones that said they don't own a PS5 yet said they would be willing to buy a PS5 console just to then buy this ""digital console"" on top of it. 

The idea was as follows:

Say that Sony takes their hardware and software source to build a proper PS2 emulator. They achieve 100% game library compatibility and add features like higher resolution rendering, high frame rate support, etc for games.

Obviously this is a big undertaking, so what if Sony said ""Hey, here's a perfect (for the sake of argument) PS2 emulator. We're calling it a 'Digital Playstation 2' and it costs 300 dollars to buy. With that, you can play any PS2 discs you still own via disc. Game developers will support this platform by re-releasing PS2 games for you to buy digitally to play on our new Digital Playstation 2 for discs you don't own or want the convenience of cloud ownership"".

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine any sort of downside to this. With source access, writing the emulators isn't nearly as complex as the guesswork is with open source emulation projects. Plus, it's a huge revenue stream. It shouldn't take that many sales to pay for the labor costs associated with this type of project. With the way things stand today, Sony is just losing a lot of potential income due to PC emulation piracy. Many of those users do it only out of convenience and would be willing to pay to support the devs of the old games they loved in the past.

Not only that, but this would get around any licensing issues with old game re-releases like Microsoft bumped up against with the Series X backcompat project. This project can also be carried forward into future generations; what I mean is maybe on the PS6 or PS7 you pay an ""upgrade fee"" to bring your digital PS2 over to the new console, maybe with even more features at that time. Obviously, this idea could be extrapolated out to all of the old consoles from all manufacturers too."

Here's a quick recap of the situation, both USB plug in and Bluetooth works with Steam Big Picture and in-game stuff as long as I add the games through steam, and Windows itself also recognizes the DualSense when I plug it in with USB Type C. The problem is however, even though Windows recognizes it when I plug it in, when I connect via BT it simply doesn't recognize that DS is connected. It doesn't recognize any of the inputs I do, nor can I play games without the help of Steam being a middleman. I have tried downloading the latest firmware from official Sony website, the controller is fully charged and the problem only lies in Bluetooth connection, but it's not as if it doesn't work at all with BT, it's just that Windows doesn't get it when it's connected with BT."

1,"Until folders arrive, I wish we could just remove games from home. It's unfortunate that folders aren't a thing yet, but that's ok I'm quite patient. What bothers me though is that I can't modify the home screen betong keeping what should stay on home. On my Samsung phone I can set it to where new apps go straight to the app drawer and do not appear on my home screen unless I place them there. Implementation of that feature would be very welcome. Every time I download something new it pushes all game tiles off the screen and sometime I forget what was on my home screen.

I'm kind of hoarder with games. I have more titles than I care to admit, although a ton are ps+ titles. Being able to sort my PS4 Pro by genre and also being able to sort each folder in a specific order of my choosing was instrumental in organizing my backlog. I would sort my games by order of interest and the ones I were currently playing would be at the front and as I completed each game I would move them to the back of the list in that folder. If I wanted to do this today, I would need to make the lists by hand and organize those lists on a separate device (laptop/pen and paper). 

When I was young I had a huge interest in gaming. The problem was that my parents weren't well off. When I did get games it was always the previous generation and I only had 3 games max that I would play obsessively. I missed out on the PS3 generation completely and came in at the tail end of the PS4 generation. My first up to date console in my life was a PS4 Pro and my very first game was Horizon Zero Dawn. I had no idea what I was walking in to. Having not played any games for like 8 years, I fell in love. 

Ever since then I wanted to catch up on lost time and hit up all the PS3 remasters and PS4 reboots and sequels. I won't say how many games I have because I'm kind of embarrassed but in the past 3 years I've beaten nearly 70 games. Idk if that's a good thing or a bad thing but either way I've been deeply satisfied, and sometimes frustrated lol during this journey. FOLDERS and being able to organize my backlog was a huge, huge help in me enjoying the numerous games I've played, and I have to say it is sorely missed. 

I'm not sure if anyone else is in the same boat but I would really, really appreciate folders being added to an update soon! I know it isn't a simple task but it would make me super happy. If they could at least let us organize the home screen more that would also be great.

Thanks for the countless hours of entertainment, here's to countless more."

1,"A Plague Tale : Innocence is a masterpiece that‚Äôs best experienced on PS5 Lets talk about the game first. The game looks beautiful. It has stunning visuals that will at times make you pause and admire it. The characters in this game feel genuine and you‚Äôll get hooked to each of them. The voice acting is out of this way world. The dialogues and conversations are well written and I personally never skipped a single sentence. The gameplay elements are unique - been playing video games for over 20 years now and this game felt like a breath of fresh air. 

The reason why I urge people to play this on a PS5 is simple - dualsense. This games takes utmost advantage of dualsense‚Äôs capabilities. I‚Äôve platinumed Miles Morales and if you think that game has great haptic feedback then wait till you play A Plague Tale.

1,"It took me so long to find this simple solution to my loud ass disc drive... And the answer is a fucking towel!

When i got my ps5 i used it vertically and some games we're obviously way too loud when reading, then one day it got way worse and i changed it to horizontally. It still made a lot of noise but not as before. I also put my ps5 on a wooden cabinet. After some research i learned that its possible that my cabinet isnt stable with the loud noise as a result. For me i became convinced that my ps5 disc drive was maybe broken, so i took it to the store where i bought it. The guy told me to take off the plates and put a cd in it and see if it still makes the same loud noises. I'm glad he told me this cause the noise was reduced and i didn't believe my disc drive was broken no more. I do believe that diffrent games are being read by a diffrent speed cause bloodborne spins the slowest of em all. That game never makes noise when reading. Elden ring comes in second and Dark Souls 3 just makes my ps5 sound like broken jet engine trying to fly away. so I took a towel and placed it under my horizontal ps5 and the disc drive noise was reduced but still not quite as it should sound... I kept it like this for a few weeks until i figured why not fold the towel one more time and it try it like that. Voila, this is all that was needed. Obviously the ps5 disc drive makes some noise when reading, but this was it. This is exactly what its supposed to sound like, and im not sure how to explain it. I think the problem lies with the ps5 plates. People have diffrent places where they put their ps5 but the plates just vibrate and give off this broken sound on a lot of diffrent platforms i believe. Also everyone has their own solution to this, cause the guy who i talked too had the same issue and he resolved it by placing a piece of clay up on his ps5 when its vertically standing, lol. So im wondering if some of you out there had this issue and if so how did you fix it?"

1,"If you played through God of War 2018 every time it came out, you will have played through it 6 times in 4 years. God of war is a great game for sure, but it has entered and exited so many PlayStation services by now that getting it for free has essentially surpassed Skyrim‚Äôs re-releases. If you played the game each time it came out on a service, you would have beaten it 6 times as of this summer:

Release in April 2018
Added to PSNow the first time (later removed)
Added to PS Plus Collection
Added to PSNow again
Being added to the new PS Plus Extra tiers
Now revealed as a June 2022 PS Plus Essential title


Again, it‚Äôs a great game for sure, but how many times do you need to release the game for free as part of the selling point of a subscription service?"
1,"Wait for higher capacity model? I am a PlayStation fan but I have not been really fussed about getting a PS5 as I still quite a few PS4 games to play and one big barrier for me was that my TV was a 9 year old 1080p TV and I wanted to experience PS5 on a 4K TV from the beginning.

So, I finally have 4K TV now and now I am debating whether to wait a few more months to see if Sony announce maybe any resign like PS5 slim or maybe a black version (I know they have official covers now) or maybe even a higher capacity model which comes maybe around 2TB native storage.

The chances of a slim version coming out this year highly unlikely and no doubt be snipped by scalpers again and black version is cosmetic (even though I not really a fan of the default white) so a possible higher capacity model by end of year is a possibility and this is what keeping me from actively hunting for PS5 now.

Yes, stocks were still short I had a chance to order in stock disk version last week and didn't do it.

So, what are your guy‚Äôs thoughts on a possibility of higher capacity model being released this year and whether it would be better to wait or get a PS5 asap if you can get one in stock at retail price?"

1,Romancing Saga -Minstrel Song- Remastered | Announce Trailer | Launches this winter  
1,"Masterpieces ala Half Life, Portal, Silent Hill, System Shock, Legend of Legaia and many many more need constant updates. Games are no music or movies. Thanks to gameplay and the fact that they are still young in comparison, the jumps from generation to generations are still high (with slowing down in the future of course‚Ä¶at least when it comes to realism (graphics)). 

Many people not only won‚Äôt but can‚Äôt play 20y old games. Hell even someone who‚Äôs first console was an Atari struggles to replay those Atari classics. 

A new generation of gamer is not the same as a new generation in life. It‚Äôs not 30years long. For millions even PS3 titles are already unplayable. They are not conditioned for them. 

The market is good with remasters but that‚Äôs not enough. 100s of games need updates. On multiple platforms. That I can‚Äôt play Half Life or Legend of Legaia on my Ps5 is ridiculous. Do we really need a Resident evil 4 remake instead of a Dino crisis remake? Count how many times RE4 got a remaster and how many times DC. And how many zombie games exists and how many Dino horror titles. RE4 is already fine. Til ps6. 

Sony also needs to refresh their ‚Äúfor all generations‚Äù titles. Thanks to mostly mature games, they are loosing million casual gamers to Nintendo. Instead of making times exclusive deals, use that money for making games ala Sly, Jak and Dexter etc. great again. I don‚Äôt care if Xbox gets the game to play or not. For me the lineup is the same. Timed exclusive or not."

I understand the whole audio copyright thing, but what I don't understand is that Duelsense and even Duelshock 4 both have an audio speaker built into them, an audio speaker that CONNECTS WIRELESSLY! If any of you can give me a clear reason why I need a stupid audio adapter for speakers, earbuds, and even the officially licensed Ps5 wireless headphones, that would be very much appreciated."

I have a Samsung 4k Crystal Pro AUE70 TV.

https://www.samsung.com/in/tvs/uhd-4k-tv/aue70-uhd-4k-smart-tv-2021-43-inch-ua43aue70aklxl/

From what I read around, it has an HDMI 2.1 port (it's labelled as HDMI eARC on the TV, port 3), but I keep getting the message that the PS5 is running at YUV422 because of HDMI 2.0.

Does this mean my TV really doesn't support HDMI 2.1? 
I've already turned on the 'Input Signal Plus' on port 3 where the eARC is present.
I'm using the HDMI cable provided with the PS5.

Thanks!"

1,"Mouse &amp; Keyboard, how popular is it ? Hello guys. This is mine first writing on PS5 subreddit. Im proud  PS5 owner seance Christmas. First of all, I'm not complaining. Im not  accusing anybody. Im just wondering, in your guys opinion, how popular M&amp;K setup on PS5 is these days. How many people are using in multiplayer games. 1%, 10%, more ?

I got PS5 last year running from PC cheaters but then again, I run in to another problem. And that is M&amp;K players. In BF5, lets say, if a guy is using mouse, hes making 90-150 kills with no problem. One guy that I played against 2 rounds, hes making  2.45 kills /min.  Something like 90:4 almost every game, 20% headshot kills etc etc. And hes not using vehicles. Im not saying its not fair, Im not accusing its cheating if PS5 is supporting the mouse out of the box. But Im not shore, do I continue  to play with controller or do I jump on to M&amp;K setup?

If those people are rare, that ok, its not a big deal, but if its more and more popular, do I switch?  


Again, you have to keep in mind how hard is to play against real cheaters on PC and how mentally  devastating is. And I was thinking, console gaming here I come, but then, M&amp;K is now more popular on a console then ever.   


So I don know what to do. I mainly playing MP gamse: BF, R6, Hell Let Loose, PUBG, Sandstorm, etc.  


Thank you."

1,"One and a half years since PS5 launched, and games still run at 60fps. Are you finally convinced that 60fps is here to stay? Just a year ago, many people still seemed to be convinced that eventually, at *some mysterious point in the future*, developers will go back to pump their resolution and visual settings to eleven and turn performance back to **30 frames per second** instead. 

Others, at the same time, claimed the increasing trend of ""performance modes"", which prioritize framerate and allow us to play at 60fps or even 120fps, will keep increasing in the future, and the option to choose performance over visual fidelity is here to stay.

We're now 1 1/2 years from launch of the PS5 (and XBox SeX), and I still happily enjoy my PS5 games at wonderfully smooth 60fps.

The way I see it: 30fps is an outdated standard - otherwise developers today wouldn't go out of their way to make their games run at 60 to begin with - and as such, 30fps is finally getting left behind. When HD resolution (1080p) became a thing, developers didn't go back to 480p just to pump their visuals up. 1080p gaming stayed and became the baseline (minus Nintendo), and finally evolved to 1440p, even native 4k. Technology evolves. Resolution evolved. Framerate evolves. This is what we're seeing here. 

The PS5 even has a ""prioritize performance"" mode integrating into its system settings!

**I'm wondering - are people still convinced we will eventually have to go back to 30fps gaming, and if so, why? Were you convinced before but changed your mind in the meantime, and if so, what was the reason? Please feel free to discuss and enjoy.**"

1,"PS5 Informational guide. All you need to know about the PS5 There are two versions of the PS5, the physical/disk version and the Digital version of the PS5, The physical/disk version will be up at the top of the list and the digital version will be closer to the bottom of the list.

The Physical/Disk version of the PS5

Price: 499$ USD or 394 GBP

The Physical version of the PS5 is the more expensive of the two for a good reason, it has a disk drive for the console and is slightly more powerful than the digital and is also the more popular version. The PS5 can back track to the PS4 but it can‚Äôt go any further than the PS4, but you can play PS1 and PS2 emulations on the PS5 by buying the game in the PlayStation game store. When you put in a PS4 disk into the PS5 it will show a PS4 icon for the game, and the same for a PS5 game but just with a PS5 icon. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.

The digital version of the PS5

Price: 399$ USD or 315 GBP

The digital version is the cheaper of the two because of the disk drive being non-existent on the digital version, unfortunately because of the disk drive not being there is it worse than the physical version. The PS5 can run PS1 and PS2 emulations by buying them in the PlayStation game store. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.


Buying the PS5

Whether you want the digital version or the physical/disk version the buying will be the same. There are two ways, the in person way or the online way, personally the in person way is much easier, the in person way is simple to do, all you need to do is call your local game store or wherever you want to buy your PS5 and ask when the next PS5 restock is and just come a couple hours early before they open and just wait, that‚Äôs the way that I did it although I had to buy it in a bundle and i spent 900$ USD for my PS5, online is more complicated, you basically need to spam click the buy button right at restock in order to have a chance to buy it or you can register your chances at the PlayStation website.

There you are, I hope this helped you out!"

1,"Demon's Souls- Amazing Game Demon's Souls came with my PS5 bundle and I gave it a few tries but ended up rage quitting each time. I'm new to Souls games and it seemed ""too hard"". After over a year of not attempting DS again, Elden Ring became all the hype. I refused to buy Elden Ring out of fear that I wouldn't stand a chance because I couldn't even play DS. So I set out and tried the game again and again (and again). After finally getting past 1-1, getting better gear, learning hit boxes and watching hella YouTube videos, I finally beat the game. The graphics of this game alone are insane and if there's anyone else out there that wanted to give it another try- I highly encourage you to try again. It's definitely one of the hardest games I've ever played (right there with Ninja Gaiden) but I'm glad I was able to get through it!!"

1,"So I posted earlier about wishing I had got a 4TB SSD, as opposed to a 2TB, so I‚Äôm going to clarify why I needed 4, and clear up some assumptions. Firstly, yes I easily filled up my 2TB drive the day I got it with solely PS5 games. As currently my owned PS5 games totals 192.

Yes I am aware I could just delete, or install them within a few minutes, but this is dependent on my location. My job however takes me to a lot of very remote locations throughout the world, for weeks, or months at a time, and I rarely even have access to basic internet capabilities.

So being able to install a plethora of games is extremely important, because not only do some days consist of sitting around doing very little; but also I have colleagues who also play on the console, who like different games.

So yes, I could delete a game and download a new one while at home, or somewhere with the ability to get online. But it‚Äôs not always an option.

1,"How long do you guys think the PS4 will last?, why cross-gen games ? After Sony's new report we can see that the PS4 playerbase is still incredibly active and that a good part of Playstation Plus subscribers and Playstation Store buyers came from PS4 and not PS5, looking at it this way you can understand why that Sony has changed its strategy and made new games like God of War: Ragnarok a cross-gen game.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people are dying to see ''only-next gen'' games as soon as possible, but honestly... as long as Sony doesn't fix the PS5's out-of-stock problem once and for all I'm not upset of the same trying to keep the PS4 for a while longer, what's the point of making exclusives for the PS5 if a lot of people won't be able to play after all?, in the end this would only negatively affect sales.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hope that by 2023 this problem is solved and the PS5 becomes more accessible, until then, I don't see anything wrong with giving people the option to continue playing on PS4."

I've heard turning on VRR can help boost framerates but I'm not sure if that also has any pros and cons.

I definitely prefer 60fps locked. I don't care that much about resolution or graphics as long as the game doesn't look like utter dogshit. Kingdom Come Deliverance looks pretty bad on the PS5 though."

The one and only game that hasn't crashed or has crashed the least is dmc5 special edition and it cant be because the data is corrupted i just set the thing up unless it somehow corrupted DURING THE CONSOLE SETUP  i dont understand how it could be this bad yeah my ps4 crashed a few times but it was only for a couple games and it was specific reasons god of war 2018 was kinda buggy on my ps4 and crashed SOMETIMES same with fallout 4 but  fallout 4 was a good but very very janky mess of a game at times even before i started using mods on it 
And i think the first spider man was a little buggy and would crash too but it was nowhere near as bad as its successor 
I cant open a game without having to hold my breath in anticipation for it to crash  now cause almost no game is safe 
EVEN ASTRO'S PLAYROOM A GAME BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM ISNT SAFE  on memory meadow it crashes WITH OUT FAIL

1,"Guide: Hacking discord to work with PS5 Hi everyone, of course it's very stupid and annoying to try to play PS5 with your discord friends on PC. Here's what you need for a workaround:

1. headphone splitter cable. I'd try to get them from a local electronics store rather than something online

2. headphones that have a removable cable, that can be connected with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable.

3. a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable. In fact, two of them.

4. a device that can run discord and has a microphone. I used my laptop.

Put it all together. Connect the jack of the headphone splitter to your headphones. From the two ports on the headphone splitter, use the two cables and connect your discord device and PS5. The headphone splitter I'm using just automatically combines the audio from both sources into the headphones. My friends can hear what I'm saying because the laptop picks it up just fine. You just have to tweak the audio on both console and device to make sure it's right.

Hope this helps someone! I was so excited when I got it to work."

However, today, I took an hour break from playing Scarlet Nexus by saving and turning off the game. I turned the game back on and the save data I loaded was yesterday's save file.

Is this a common bug? Did something happen to my local save file I did an hour ago that caused the console to retrieve the last backed up data from the cloud?"

1,"Some PSVR games already have upgrade/next-gen patch on PS5 even with old PSVR. This is something I don't see a lot of people commenting on, but some games already have massive improvement when played on PS5 even though it's a PS4 app, sure... it's still limited by the resolution of the original PSVR, but I think when PSVR 2 arrives it will probably be backwards compatible with the original PSVR games so it's really nice to know that some games already run better when played on the PS5 even with the original PSVR.

&amp;#x200B;

Of the two games I know are:

&amp;#x200B;

Zenith: The Last City :

When played on PS4 or PS4 Pro the game has very large loadings times on some areas, on the PS5 these loadings times do not exist, in addition the resolution is better, texture quality is slightly better and the draw-distance is much greater.

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw)

&amp;#x200B;

No Man's Sky VR :

The PS4 version is a blurry mess, on PS5 not only the resolution is much better but also the texture quality, shadow quality, foliage and etc... is much higher.

[https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE](https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE)

&amp;#x200B;

There are other games like Star Wars Squadrons, Hubris VR and Swordsman VR that apparently also have significant improvements when played on PS5 even with the original PSVR, but I can't confirm about this game, I wonder if more other games like Resident Evil 7 will get it. upgrade to PS5 in the future."

1,"Ps5 vs series X 
I know this is a question that is often asked esp. on this sub so my apologies but there‚Äôs been a lot of developments as of late so I feel like this time around that classic question of Xbox X vs ps5 is different. 


For the longest time, I told myself I'm getting a Xbox series X mainly because of Gamepass and how awesome it is. Even when Sony announced their new competitor. But now, I'm really torn. On the one hand, gamepass is still awesome. Especially with the Blizzard-Activision acquisition which could bring COD to gamepass which is major news for me because now I don't have to shell out 60 dollars every year. But at the same time Sonys competitor is seriously starting to look good. Just today, they announced some Ubisoft classic games (certain curated games) are coming to the Extra bundle of The new ps plus (article: Ubisoft classic). I also really am a fan of the new Sony controller. If anyone has been keeping up with all the recent news I would really appreciate some advice.

Sorry for any typos, doing all this on phone lol."

1,"PS5 emulators should be made to work with ps3 , ps2 , psx discs. A bit of context here. I've always been a PlayStation guy , not because I'm a fanboy or anything , its just Xbox is really unpopular where i live and back in the day there weren't many OG xbox's and 360's. So i bought the ps2 , psp , ps3 , ps4 and now ps5. Also I don't like digital games , I like physical copies and if i get a chance to buy a physical copy i usually go for it . That's also mostly because internet back in the ps2 , ps3 cycle , in my country wasn't good. So i have all these ps2 games , ps3 games that are just lying there .  
A CD if preserved can last up to 200 years , most ps3's break down after like 12-15 years of normal use.   
So all those CD's which are memories, mementoes from past which i paid for at that time are just paperweights and will be paperweights after my ps3 eventually breaks down. i was so happy when i learnt that ps5 will have ps4 disc's backwards compatibility. I mean sure the new PS Plus subscription is fine and dandy and allows you to play classic ps games but i don't want to pay 120 dollars a year to play games that i already own. On the other hand Xbox has done such a good job with backwards compatibility everything starting from the OG xbox to xbox one is backwards compatible (sure there are some games that you cant play) and you don't have to pay a subscription to pay the games if you already own its physical copy , just put it in and voila.  We all know a ps5 can do ps3 emulation , its plenty powerful . Why does Sony ignore the ps3 like this . It really pisses me off lol."

I got gran turismo 7 over a week ago and I don't play my ps5 everyday due to work and stuff so it's mainly a weekend thing. So yeah I started playing gran turismo 7 and loving it! But thought I want to go back to another game I need to finish. Dying Light 2 to be exact and Lord behold it can't read the disc, Comes up with the error unreadable disc. So I tried a few other discs like last of us part 2 and other ps4 and none would read. But as soon as I put gran turismo 7 back in it reads it fine? 
After that I booted into safe mode and did a clear system software cache and rebuild the database which worked. It read all the other games fine. I even played dying light 2 for abit. After that I thought I'd try gran turismo again and yep you guessed it..  won't read any other discs bar that one.. Great... so did what I did before rebuild the database etc. But this time it didn't work. Fab... so went back to safe mode and checked if there was an update im missing just incase i didn't get a notification for it. And there was so the ps5 updated and it reads discs again but I'm scared to put gran turismo back in incase it messes the ps5 up üòÖ

1,"My Playstation 5 is showing picture glitches in PS Plus menu! Hi everyone!

Hope all of you are doing fine, I am new to the community and I recently had the privilege of buying myself a brand new PS5. It is barely 10 days old, I have set it up and was enjoying it on tcl c728 QLED tv. Everything was fine until today when I started to observe very irritating glitches in the PS Plus menu. So, the thing is where the whole PS plus library is listed, this one game (Days Gone) image is all weird and by weird I mean a glitch. Every other title is fine (appearance wise, it is as it should be).

Now hovering down there is another glitch on one of the blocks of Ps Plus menu and text appears shadowy and there are pixels everywhere. Apart from that everything is fine, the games, other menu items, the setting, all is solid except the Ps Plus menu. **(For some reason I can't attach any screenshots here)**

**Following are the things that I have tried;**

**-Restarting the PS5**

**-Shutting it down and powering it back on**

**-Changing from ethernet to Wi-Fi and from Wi-Fi back to the ethernet**

Nothing seems to fix it and it is driving me crazy, it is a completely brand new device, the PS5 itself and the TV. Can't pinpoint what the issue might be. If anyone can help me I shall be very thankful. I wasn't able to find anything regarding this issue not on Google, YouTube or even Reddit. Seems like a special case.

Plz help!

P.S. It appears that for some reason Days Gone logo is being replaced with a sack boy block that is below the games. Please any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks"

1,My 1 year review I've had my PS5 for about 16 months now and here's my experience. First off I'd like to say the main reason I was dying for a PS5 was that crispy demons souls remake. And man did it live up to its expectations. If it wasn't for demons souls remake being a PS5 exclusive I probably still wouldn't have one. When I first got my PS5 and played Astros playroom I was all smiles. So this is what next gen will feel like. I was so excited. But then none of the games besides returnal used those features. The console is still too new and I understand that. But even a game like demons souls which was a PS5 exclusive didn't use or even have a option to use those features. It's a perfect console and I can't wait to see what games feel like in a few years when they all use the haptics / adaptive triggers.

1,"Dualsense vibration becomes rattling after prolonged playing Basically what title says: I have a PS5 for couple of months, and recently I noticed, while playing God of War, that after like 30 minutes of playing, the vibration of the Dualsense controller becomes much louder, kinda like rattling or rumbling, as if there was something loose inside the controller.

When I shake the controller manually, I hear nothing. When I wait for couple of minutes, and continue playing, it is still there. First I thought it's intentional loud vibration from the game. But when I turn off the controller, just for a couple of seconds, and turn it on again, it goes away. The vibrations become soft purrs again. And it returns again after 15 minutes of playing or so.

Anyone experiencing anything similar? It doesn't seem like a hardware issue, as it goes away with just turning off and on again. I have to check if it happens with other games too, but I believe it does. It doesn't affect gameplay, it's just a bit unsettling. Not sure if I can even claim a warranty for this.

So recently I got the PS5 and I have the new version of the dualsense controller (At the back of the controller, look for the FCC ID, and if the letter ends with the ""A"", it is the new version, if ends with ""1"", it is the launch version, meaning the old one), the controller's speaker output is really low compared to the old one, my uncle has a old version, and the speaker out put is what it should be, but my new version one it is really low"

This only happens when I take it out of rest mode. Never had an issue like this with my PS4. 

I have a set of AKG connected to a sound blaster. The PS5 is recognising the SB and again, this only happens coming out of rest mode. 

Anyone else had this issue? I've seen it with controllers, mics etc. Seems to be a USB thing I'd imagine."

Even when I turn my system volume and game volume all the way up it's still a lot quieter than I would like. Anyone know a fix?  


Side note: The airpods work just fine when used with a different device and the audio for my ps5 is plenty loud when connected to a different output device."
1,"Ps5 dualsense, should I regret this decision? So I just bought the cosmic red dualsense because the dualsense that came with the ps5 lasted with me for a year and it's joystick completely broke down. I've done my research before on what controller I should get but I haven't done it that well. I read in an article posted by someone that said the new controllers have gotten an upgrade. joysticks and triggers/buttons, I got mixed up and though the cosmic red came out with the starlight blue and the other 2 colors but after purchasing the controller I have just realised that the cosmic red is older and it might not have that significant upgrades and changes. Am I in the wrong? Have the ""older"" dualsense that are newer than the original dualsense been improved than the original white? Has Sony changed the cosmic red and black dualsense after they've started to sell the newer three colors? Should I stay with the cosmic red or get a refund and buy another one?

I still have the warranty but my little sister completely demolished the box."

I play only FIFA so I‚Äôll describe the symptoms of the problem with it. 
So basically the thing is that they are lagging. The commands are happening inside the game with like 1-2 seconds of delay. If I‚Äôm running towards the opponents goal and then want to turn, my player just proceeds running into this direction. Passes, shots, changing the defending player. Everything.
But it‚Äôs coming in waves‚Ä¶ so the problems appear for a minute and then suddenly go away.

I feel like their imaginations are limited or that they were trained without knowing it to have low expectations.

I can‚Äôt wait until world building is not dictated by forced walking sections, crawl sections, squeeze sections, and elevator sections, and land layout dictated by hiding loading screens.

I can‚Äôt wait until we can see some actual improvements to all animation and physics systems along with improvements to AI.

1,"Porting games to PC Sony recently released sales numbers on a few games they've ported to PC.

Horizon Zero Dawn:
Copies Sold- 2.39 million
Revenue- 60 million

Days Gone:
Copies Sold- 852k
Revenue- 22.7 million

God of War:
Copies sold- 971k
Revenue- 26.2 million

Based on these numbers I can definitely see why Sony waits so long to port over their games. GOW selling &gt;1 million copies, in about half a year makes me think two things. 1. PC gamers pirated that game alot. 2. PC gamers are not as enthusiastic about PS games as some believed. I know the game has only been out for about 5 months but a game that big and beloved should have sold more I feel. Especially given the fact that it's release was alot better than HZD's. 

I don't have a problem with PC releases but if this is what Sony gets then Day 1 is certainly out of the question for probably every first party release. Anyone with their hopes up for a Bloodborne PC port these numbers don't look good for that. I'd put my money on a 60 fps update.

Let me know if you agree or came to different conclusions based on the figures they released. I've seen some ""discussion"" online (Twitter) but I felt like this is the better space for that."

1,"PS5 glitch/freeze/Idk ? So, today I had just closed ‚ÄòTomb Raider‚Äô on My ps5, when I quickly went into one of my friends profiles. While scrolling through his games, the list stopped updating/loading. I hit ‚ÄòO‚Äô to go all the way back to the Home Screen, and when I tried to get back to my profile using the quick access bar, it would not go through.

My PS5 didn‚Äôt necessarily freeze as I could still navigate around the menu, but nothing was loading (psstore, psplus, nothing), and whenever I selected a prompt like going to settings or, even turning it off, nothing happened. Even when I hovered over the game, there were no stats of your trophies in the corner, or even a ‚ÄòPlay game‚Äô button. Also noticed that my online status had be greyed out.

I tried to log out, which it actually did, but didn‚Äôt show me the actual profiles page, just the background graphic, of the light shining through the grey.

Eventually I had to take it off by the plug, because it wasn‚Äôt letting me manually turn off (in retrospect, I just learnt that it takes 20 secs of holding down the button to hard reset, which I didn‚Äôt hold for that long, so that‚Äôs on me). All seems to be fine now.

Anyone have any idea what happened, and if I need to worry? Thanks in advance"
1,New Witcher Game Currently in Pre-Production With 100+ Devs; Cyberpunk 2077 Next-Gen Update Boosted Sales  
1,"So... about cross-gen games. Honestly I don't blame Sony for revising their strategy and making future releases like God of War: Ragnarok become cross-gen games.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people want to see ''only-next-gen'' games but what's the point if this is going to significantly affect the game's sales since a lot of people can't even find a PS5 to buy yet?

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the new Horizon is the most beautiful game I've seen on PS5 so far and it's a cross-gen game that came out for PS4 too, if the next cross-gen releases don't affect the quality of the next-gen versions then I'm more than satisfied, people need to play this game, if ps4 is the only option for them to play then great, i don't think it's bad to keep cross-gen games for another year, at least until this out of stock issue and scalpers is finally resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, what doesn't make sense is to want only-next-gen games while this problem is not solved once and for all, this is even a little selfish if you stop to think about it."

Anyway my question is how likely am I to actually get that PS5 tomorrow? Do they invite more people then they have stock for and is it like a normal restock event where it‚Äôs first come first serve or am I guaranteed one as long as I log on right away and purchase it. I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up to much but I‚Äôm super excited for tomorrow! Been looking forward to a PS5 for a long time now."

I see a lot of games in the PS+ collection, but unsure if I would play all them. Mostly Arkham knight and god of war I think. Not sure whether or not to get the subscription or just buy for cheap now.


I wanted to know how many of you guys buy your games (digital or disc) vs paying for Sonys gaming subscription (any tier) and why it makes sense for your gaming lifestyle."

I moved from Aus to UK and brought my PS5 with me. I know a lot about the region difficulties with PSN etc. but I just wanted to ask for a hypothetical scenario. Let's say Horizon Forbidden West came out with DLC. I have bought a physical copy of that game in the UK not Australia (which is where my PSN is situated). If DLC were to hypothetically come out for it, would it be possible for me to buy that DLC for my UK copy of Horizon and for it to work?

I know I can't buy DLC from a different PSN storefront, but as far as I understand, for DLC to work it just needs to match the product/region code of the game, as far as I am aware the UK and Aus have the same region as they both have PPSA on the sides of their game covers and they are both in R2? So in theory the DLC should work? Thanks in advance!"

Right now the next game that really has my interest is going back to godfall with the ultimate edition being on sale. I enjoyed while I just never really had the time to play a lot of it.

If so, seems like it doesn't make sense to use the card and add another year on top of my existing subscription."

I don't know why but i find most PS exclusives these days pretty stale and boring (they all feel the same with a different setting to me) and am having much more fun playing the PS3 titles. Maybe i'm just getting old xD

1,"When should I order the PS5? Hello there,

I finally decided to pick the PS5 over the Xbox (which might be stupid, as you get one and can't lay hand on the other), mainly for Hogwarts Legacy (my Computer ain't working Three Kingdoms anymore, so it was that or a new computer for six times the price to play the exact same games), and I've really grown confused with all that Drops as of now.
But since I don't technically need it before Legacy comes out around September/October, I'm not really sure which guide to believe, as they all say something different. Many people seem to say that one should pick the first offer you can grab, as production will expectedly take a huge blow over the summer (or so they say), while others say to patiently wait until price drops to what its supposed to be.
I'm not really sure, so I'm gonna ask her - I don't really wanna pay an extra 200 for buying it right now, but it seems to be completely impossible to grab hold of one for the regular price now. Should I grab it immediately when there is one I can get or wait for the perfect offer?"

The 2nd is that there is no chat-mix at all.  Now out comes the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless which should be a better version of the Arctis pro wireless.

1,"Can we stop with the fake ""alpha/beta"" titles and properly call them stress tests? It is just so obsurd to think that a developer would give alpha/beta access to console players on AAA titles.    On PC some small indie devs, sure they may do that if want to spread the word but definitely not to thousands.     Maybe a few dozen.  

Why is this done?   Because publishers think it makes players feel *special"" and I guess gives bragging rights.  (I been playing since the beta).    Idk I guess kids care about that crap.    These beta/alpha ""tests"" are actually what the gaming industry considers as ""stress tests"" .        I have seen a few times where devs will say it's a stress test before launch but majority of the time it's alpha/beta. 

When a game is development during the alpha stages most textures/animations are not even finalized and the only people who could even get a sneak peek were game journalists but were under heavy NDAs.   The real NDAs where at the very least you were kicked out of the gaming industry if not facing jail time and heavy fines to ruin your life. 

I don't know why I let it bother me so much I guess it's always been a pet peeve of mine.     When a game has already gone gold and they are still doing a ""beta"" test it just annoys me when someone finds a genuine complaint only to be met with ""Its just the beta it will be fixed at launch"".  Ugh no that's not...... Nevermind"

1,"I cannot believe how much fun Multiversus is. About 20-25 hours in so far playing the closed Alpha and it‚Äôs so much fun. This is a full blown live service ‚ÄúSmash‚Äù experience, albeit in its own take of course.

There‚Äôs so much to do, *so much to earn*, ranked mode, battle passes, custom lobbies, every single character has their voice actors returning to voice them, etc etc etc. The fighting feels so satisfying too! 

You get like 300 coins when winning a match, and each character costs 2,000 coins to unlock so its rather fast (could very well change for launch but it should be similar). They‚Äôre going to make their money mainly with skins and to get characters faster, and *man* are they leaning into the fan service!

One of my favorite shows of all time is Adventure Time, the closed Alpha has a free battlepass that goes to level 50 and one and of the skins is an alternate version of Jake, Cake, from [Fiona and Cake](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZrUbFfztHvXE4P5i9)! And you guessed it, they brought the VA who voices Cake to voice the lines as well! This is just one example of many. They could have easily done something super simple like Jake in a number of outfits, so I was shocked they‚Äôre already doing stuff like this, the fan-service is going to be **real** haha.

The biggest indicator for me was a few of my friends who are HUGE into Smash, they still play every single week, go to tournaments, hang out at weekly Smash events, and ever since they started playing the Alpha they *have not stopped playing it*, they‚Äôre loving it! So excited for open beta when everyone can play.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but I genuinely think this will be up there with Smash."

1,"Best method to split HDMI 2.1 cable to 2.1 Video with toslink optical audio out to Dolby Digital DTS amp Finally managed to get hold of a PS5 only to discover they've ditched the onboard toslink connector! 

My TV is a Samsung QE55Q70R - not 2.1 (2.0b?) but does do stuff at 120Hz + freesync etc

From what I'm reading, people are suggesting using the optical audio out on the TV. However, I'm worried about 2 things. Firstly latency (as the trip will be longer than from the PS5 straight to the amp) and also I'm not sure if my TV can support it (just tested with my PS4 setup - this is using a hdmi 2.0 cable though - however - can't select Dolby Digital as the audio out when the PS4 is running on it).

I'm thinking the best solution would be to bring the 2.1 HDMI out for the ps5 into one of those splitter boxes, which outputs hdmi video out and also provides a toslink output, which can then go straight to my amp. However, I'm worried about whether these boxes effecting both the audio and video quality. 

Firstly, would this be an OK approach and secondly are there any recommended brands of the splitter boxes?

I've tried to get my head around ""Arc"" - but baffles me a bit - just need an optical out carrying DTS 5.1."

When we both started off unable to play cross-console, we were both NAT type 3, and aimed to fix it. But whenever we follow whatever is recommended online to fix NAT type issues, one of us goes to NAT type 2 as planned, while the other stays in 3. Then, we follow another method, and the Type 2 gets switched over to the other console, and the other has Type 3. This problem has persisted for the past two days now, and despite constant efforts to be able to play with each other, no posts online have seemed to work, which is very disheartening, since I gave my roommate a PS4 so that we had things in common for us to play.

1,"This needs to be spread out. PlayStation is making users to pay back the discount they got when upgrading membership. It was exciting when I found out the new PlayStation Plus service tiers have arrived, but my joy was gone within seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's how much Sony charges for all three tiers of membership in Hong Kong:**

**Essential: HKD 308**

**Extra: HKD 515**

**Deluxe: HKD 599**

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 years and 19 days left.

I bought my 4 years of membership for the price of HKD 231/205/205/205, when it was discounted last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**At first, I thought I only have to pay for the differences between Essential and Deluxe, which should be:**

**(599-308) x 3=873**

**And 19 days should be:**

**(599-308) √∑ 365 x 19=15.15**

**Total should be:**

**873+15.15=HKD 888.15**

&amp;#x200B;

**But Sony decides I have to pay back the discount I got last year.**

**Here's the calculation:**

**(599-205)=394 x 3=1182**

**(599-231) √∑ 365 x 19=19.16**

**Total: 1182+19.16=1201.16**

&amp;#x200B;

**Almost identical to the price Sony is asking on the upgrade page.**

&amp;#x200B;

I understand it might cost a lot for Sony to launch the service, but seriously, taking back the discounts I've gotten already? That's low.

1,"I'm so disappointed in the new PS plus I am a PlayStation player of Hong Kong. This morning, I excitedly opened PS5 and prepared to upgrade my PS plus to extra to download new games. But in the upgrade interface, I vaguely felt that there was an upgrade price problem. I'll explain that in more details.

1. There is only one option for you to upgrade your PS plus. Upgrade all remaining days or not upgrade. And if you purchased PS Plus with a discount before, you need to pay SONY back all the money of the previous discount when upgrading.

2. When new PS plus published, SONY announced that there would be more than 400 games in PS plus extra. In fact, there are only 247 games in the library. And if a game has ps4 and PS5 versions, it counts as two games. In summary, the actually number of games should be no more than 200. And there are some PS4 games that I think are in tier 2 libraries that actually need tier 3 to play.

I bought a one-year PS Plus membership at a discount of 205HK before. The cost of my upgrade is 222.51HK. According to my expectation, I need to pay 148HK for the upgrading:(515-308)\*261/365=148HK

But I actually need a lot more than that, so I do the math

(515-205)\*((261+1)/365)=222.52

So, upgrade cost = (original price - the price you actually paid) \* ((remaining days +1) /365)

It means that no matter how long you bought it at the discount price, SONY now requires you to pay the full price if you want to upgrade your PS plus, and you have to upgrade the remaining days all at once.

All in all, the new PS plus are not as good as I expected. and one more question, why pictures are not allowed in raddit?"

She has gotten really good and is out of games to play.  She recently bought Elden Rings and couldn't get into it.  Games she has really liked include: all the Tomb Raiders, Uncharted's, the two Horizon Dawn games, Fallout 4.  She also played Pathless, Kena Bridge of Spirits, Ratchet &amp; Clank and liked those but not as much as the first few.  Any ideas for games similar to this would be greatly appreciated.  I've been downloading all the free PS Plus games for a few years now so any of those we already have.  Thanks!"

1,"If your original PS plus membership was purchased with a discount, Sony will include the difference in the discounted price into the upgrade fee when you upgrade to PS Extra/Deluxe membership. I purchased PS+ last year with a 50% discount which is 154HKD/year. Here we do a simple maths problem.

The original PS Plus in HK is 308HKD/year, and the PS Deluxe in HK is 599HKD/year

The difference should be 599-308=291HKD/year.  This is equal to 0.797HKD/day. That means my upgrade fee for 88 days should be 70HKD.

However, the fact is my upgrade fee for 88 days is 107.28 HKD = 1.219 HKD/day.

599-154=445HKD/year. This is equal to 1.219HKD/day.

Definitely, SIE is one of the greediest publishers I‚Äòve ever seen.

I delete the game and reinstall, only to have the same problem. Disc's will eject and I'll have to start over.

1,"PS5 can't eject discs properly My PS5 just started having problems ejecting discs, sometimes it will do it just fine but other times it won't and it will make this really loud clicking sound, using the manual eject screw works though.

I was in contact with PS support and was informed that it's only 12 months warranty (I live in Sweden) and that my PS5 is no longer covered by the warranty and to fix the problem I'd need to send it in for repairs and pay 2900 SEK (around ‚Ç¨276/ $295) and that's almost half the cost of a new PS5.

I've heard that having it horizontal instead of vertical helps but I tried that and the success/ failure rate is about the same as in vertical, is there anything I can really do other than just send it in or just live with it and treat it like a digital PS5?"

This seemed to cause a bigger issue as now everything is in the wrong pitch and a horrible static noise starts whenever the audio level changes. This makes it impossible to hear voice acting or singing as there is this static over all of it.

I have tried putting in different headphones but the problem is still there. Is there any way to fix this or do I need a new controller?"

1,"Current Disappointment About 2 months ago I finally bit the bullet and got the PS5 for a relatively decent price all things considered. It works great, the haptic feedback is amazing, the load times are phenomenal and I only had one crash so far. The issue is, I'm pretty much just using it as an upgraded PS4, because sadly the games so far for the 5 have just been so... terrible. 

The moment I had finished setting up I downloaded dying light 2, I had loved the first games flaws and all, got nearly 600 hours into it over the last 5 years or so, I had purposely avoided spoilers, and was excited for the sequel to pick up where the last had left off, search for a cure, and explore a larger parkour and zombie slaying paradise. 

Instead we got parkour so floaty it feels like you're full of helium, combat so utterly tedious you end up trying to run past enemies just so you don't have to deal with them, a story so depressing, cliche and bland it feels like it was written at the last minute, two factions who barely matter, barely any weapons compared to the last game, and an RPG outfit and skill system that feels completely unfinished and useless. 

So after forcing myself through that hot mess just to see the ending and complete it, I moved on to another sequel I was excited about, Horizon: Forbidden west. Yes the game actually came out, though everyone was to busy playing elden ring to notice. 

So, HFW... at first it was great, the open world was huge and diverse, the story and dialogue were interesting, but then.. the combat, so utterly unbalanced you end up changing over to story difficulty just so you don't die to the mandatory boss in the storyline 40 times. The black box quest is bugged to hell, many weapons feel like you're trying to kill a Trex with a nail gun, concentration is supposed to  slow down the game as you aim so you can nail those vulnerable spots right? Well good luck as it seems the arrows go wherever the hell they want sometimes, and when you go into slowmo, the models start to freak out and spaz around like a crate stuck in a wall in Garry's mod. Then the story just slowly gets less and less intriguing, the characters lose motivation, the combat just gets harder and harder, oh and if you think maybe you just need the best gear, go to the arena and get it, yeah I dare you, it's one of the most unbalanced, tedious, and brutal things I've ever seen, and you have to PAY EACH TIME YOU TRY IT. 

now I'm just back to playing my old favorites with thankfully much faster load times and some improved hdr and fr. and the only PS5 game I actually play is vanguard, which is hit or miss depending on the internet of the other players and how many tryhards their are in a given match, and also the weapons are so unbalanced theirs like 3 that are actually worth even using so, it can get boring pretty fast. 

I'm sure I'm gonna get hit with alot of 'git gud' which I guess is to be expected, I'm sure elden ring is amazing, but I don't wanna pay 60 dollars to get destroyed 50 times in a row, to some that's wonderful I get it, it's a challenge to overcome, but to me that just sounds so depressing and exhausting. 

Now I look forward, and pray to God that GOW Ragnarok and Sniper Elite 5 are good, I'm currently playing through sniper elite 4 rn, and somehow this 6 year old game has a stealth system 50 times better than the new gen games. Anyway, I just needed to vent, if you guys have any recommendations for PS5 games feel free to send them my way."

So, where I am just now I'm using a decent 27' 1080p gaming monitor, have access to 4k TV but not too fussed about that just now. Anyway, obviously I'm going to install Horizon, Astro and fuck around with all the new features. 

But, what I'm really looking forward to is the loading times/frame rate for my PS4 games like: TLOU2, Spider-Man, Death Stranding (I'm going to try again to enjoy it), Bloodborne, and a slew of other PS4 games until I eventually go online again and everything else when I move out of here.

I just recently got HFW, although it‚Äôs beautiful graphically, I enjoy more melee dominant based games, and I feel like this game heavily relies on ranged weapons.

Honestly my game collection has been dry for like a year and I was really bored and jumped the gun on HFW cause it looked dope (not saying it isn‚Äôt a great game, I just don‚Äôt enjoy the combat mechanics heavily favouring ranged weapons)

I‚Äôm looking for games with a 3rd person large open world with good combat mechanics that isn‚Äôt too hectic (Soulsborne games included) , I‚Äôve played and looking for something similar to:

Witcher 3
Ghost of Tsushima
Red dead Redemption 2

AC Valhalla
The division
Days Gone

To provide even more context, I‚Äôm excited to play (barring any flops ü§ûüèΩ):
Hogwarts Legacy
Forspoken
Black Myth Wukong

Got a PS5 to play games but realized I enjoy a certain set of games and there‚Äôs nothing out (that I know of) that honestly grabs my attention.

If you‚Äôve got any suggestion by all means drop some and I‚Äôd appreciate it."

It is just one solid piece of plastic that houses the fan and everything else with no access cover period.

I don't know what to do now.  I saw the external SSD's only allow storage, and no playing of PS5 games if you don't use the internal storage.

I think it has something to do with the muscle deformation suits, which unfortunately has my favorite suit the Classic one. Apparently the deformation affects frame rate, and it seems to be true as the og suit u get (sportswear) runs perfectly fine.

1,"No way to share HDR screenshots? Been getting into virtual photography as PS5 games can be quite beautiful, but only just now noticed how heavily compressed my screenshots are getting when copied to USB. I have HDR enabled, which I can see the difference on my TV, but they get compressed horribly when saved to USB.

I've shared some analysis here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/HorizonScreenshots/comments/uurepo/can\_anyone\_tell\_the\_difference/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorizonScreenshots/comments/uurepo/can_anyone_tell_the_difference/)  


In that I also refer to this older thread:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k6lc0e/ps5\_screenshots/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k6lc0e/ps5_screenshots/)  


The workaround mentioned there in which you view an existing HDR screenshot on the PS5 and then take a new PNG screenshot of it, seems to almost reach the quality as if it had been saved PNG originally. But only the HDR version viewed on the PS5 has the full HDR effect. I'm really wondering what image format the PS5 uses internally for HDR and if we will ever be able to copy that off the PS5. Also note that in my analysis, none of the sizes matched on the USB versus what the PS5 said they were.  


TLDR: Probably best to save PNG and lose HDR."

Remove the batteries. Look at the bottom of the batteries.  One of them likely has corrosion on it (white powder) the spring inside the remote will look slightly damaged (not 100% silver/ looked like it was sanded).

The fix:

I folded a paper towel. Wet it.  Wring it dry. Rub the corroded spring.  Then dry it. Remote should work instantly.  If you follow any of the PS official guides and deleted the remote from bluetooth, just renege to re-pair it.

I posted this because there was no other fix i found online and wasn't going to rebuy a product that'll just break again in one year.

1,"ThiGames and ""The Jumping Burger"" constantly moving up the ""New Games"" category So I noticed this trophy-scumming game constantly moving up the New Games list somehow despite having been released 7 days ago. I suspect this is due to them somehow pushing it up by releasing a similar game aka ""The Jumping Taco"" and the fact that there's already another release coming in 6 days called ""The Jumping Pizza."" Considering how low effort these games are and the fact that the new titles are literally pallet swaps, this garbage is shoving down actual indie games and preventing them from getting any real front page advertising on the PSN store.

While this is hardly the first game like this, it is the first to pump them out every week and abuse the system to push them to the top of the games list. There's only one real reason to buy this game too, and that's to inflate your trophy list and platinums, but even then ***what is the point.*** Trophies do absolutely nothing outside of comparing with other uses on a title by title basis, and even then this game sticks out more than a smut game like Waifu Impact. You wouldn't even want this on your list since it indicates that you paid to get some worthless trophies to try to inflate a score that is meaningless."

But what I‚Äôve tried to research and no luck with, is whether the V-Moda will provide Sidetone/monitoring so I can hear my voice through the earphones.

Does anyone know if they will do this at all? I also know that via the Sony App, there is a setting for ‚ÄòAmbient Sound Control‚Äô, which also has a ‚Äòfocus on voice‚Äô checkbox. Would this do the job when the v-mods mic is attached for sidetone?

After a game session I usely put my console in rest mode to charge my controller. I adjusted the energy settings so that my PS5 gives power to my controller for 3 hours. I didn't select the ""keep connected to the internet"" option, so my console should ONLY give power to my controller for 3 hours.

On the PS4, this option would mean that after 3 hours in rest mode, the console would turn itself off. Completely.

Why doesn't my PS5 turn off after 3 hours in rest mode? I don't want to keep my console in rest mode the whole night. Is there an option I'm missing?"

1,"The disc drive is a bane of the PS5 experience I love my PS5. It took me a long time to finally acquire one, but I finally got one, specifically the disc version.

One of the biggest improvements from the PS4 is the level of noise it makes. Its fan is very quiet, even when playing demanding games. The PS4 sounded like a jet taking off, the PS5 sounds like a small electric fan that you would use on a hot day. The problem, however, is the disc drive at times can completely shatter this improvement. The disc drive spinning at full speed, sounds just like a PS4.

The disc drive in the PS5 is a UHD Blu-ray player. The discs used can be up to 100GB in size. It makes perfect sense for it to spin at full speed when installing a new game, as installing a game as fast as possible is what we all want right? Of course. The problems with the disc drive is *after* the game has installed. There are 2 main problems:

**DRM**

This mechanism within the PS5 causes the disc drive to spin every so often when playing a disc based game. I‚Äôve never timed how frequently it does this, but let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs 45 minutes. So every 45 minutes when you‚Äôre playing your disc version of Elden Ring, you will hear the disc drive boot up at full speed.

The problem isn‚Äôt the DRM process itself, as obviously this mechanism needs to exist so that the console knows the disc is still legitimate and not pirated. The problem is with how fast the disc drive spins the disc. You would think that the disc drive would default to a much slower speed when checking for DRM. But no. It defaults to spinning at maximum speed, like you‚Äôre installing the game again.

This is incredibly inconvenient as if you‚Äôre playing your games at night and don‚Äôt want to disturb loved ones in your room or next door, it can potentially wake them. Why does it have to be this way? Imo, Sony should make it so that DRM checks run at a much slower speed as I don‚Äôt see the need to maximum speed for something so non-bandwidth heavy like a DRM check.

**Playing other games**

This is even somewhat more annoying than the previous issue. The PS5 decides to boot up the disc drive upon selecting a game that isn‚Äôt even the game you have on disc.

What do I mean? I have Elden Ring in my PS5, I select a digital game I have installed like Call of Duty: Vanguard, yet the disc drive still boots. How does this make sense? Why is Elden Ring spinning when I play a different game? It seems that Sony has programmed this too simplistic. The logic of the software is pretty much play game -&gt; DRM check disc, whereas it should ideally function as play *disc* game -&gt; DRM check.

This makes it frustrating when you‚Äôre trying to be quiet around loved ones at night. You think you‚Äôre safe playing a different game yet the disc drive decided to boot up anyways.

**Booting up the PS5**

Let‚Äôs say you want to avoid these issues at night, by watching Netflix. You have your loved one asleep nearby and you boot up your PS5 without selecting any game to avoid any audible noise from the disc drive or fan. Well tough luck, as the disc drive spins at full speed upon turning the PS5 on.

So no matter what you do, the PS5 will make a racket if you have a disc inside it. The current solution may be ‚Äújust take the disc out after using it‚Äù, but this isn‚Äôt the best solution. Ideally, the PS5 should assort to us, not us adapt to it. These inconveniences are all fixable by Sony. Besides, we all live busy lives at least some of do. We don‚Äôt all have our PS5s in the back of our mind with every living minute. Being forced to eject the disc at the start of every day so late night gameplay is quiet is inconvenient in itself.

Sony should improve this situation for disc users. There‚Äôs no reason the disc drive needs to spin at full speed upon booting up the PS5. There‚Äôs definitely no reason it should spin up at all when playing digital games. There‚Äôs no reason why it has to spin at full speed when performing DRM checks."

1,Evil Dead: The Game Review  
1,"Looking for a couch co-op game I can play with my wife. Details inside! So my wife and I want to play a game together but haven't found something that fits what we are looking for.

We've played a good amount of It Takes Two and will eventually get to A Way Out, but are looking for something different. We've also played a lot of Gloomhaven digital on Steam, but am looking for something on PS. Portal 2 is on the list as well, but it's only PC as far as I know.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is what we are looking for:**

Couch Co-Op

No first person shooter, wife isn't a fan.

No top down, wife isn't a fan (Tried diablo 3 and what is what she didn't like). That being said, 3rd person would maybe be ideal, but first person is fine too. 

Preferably something where we can play the story together, not just rounds/challenges like overcooked which we've also played some of. 

Fantasy/Medieval is probably ideal, but open to other genres. 

Not super clunky. This is a weird one, but how smooth it all feels makes a big difference. If it feels like crap to play, my wife will give up rather quickly. 

Not too complicated RPG elements. I've played a lot of RPGs and MMOs and whatnot in my life but if there is too deep of a crafting or magic system, it loses my wife. For example, she tried The Witcher 3 and just found it to be too overwhelming to try and learn for someone who doesn't normally play that type of game. But I want some depth for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember we played some of an old lord of the rings game on PS2 that was great some years back but haven't found something that does all the same things. Something like a co-op Skyrim would be perfect. I know there is a mod for PC that we will try at some point. 

But any help or suggestions is appreciated."

1,"PS5 auto turns on when it's HDMI input is selected Hi all

My PS5 auto turns on whenever my tv tunes to its HDMI input (HDMI 2 in this case). Is it possible to configure this CEC behavior to not auto turn on when on its HDMI input?

This is an issue because if I play my PS5, turn off the system and tv, then go back to watch TV or something, the TV goes to its last input (HDMI 2) which turns on the PS5, so I have to manually turn it back off before I can switch to watching TV.

I also like the ability to turn on the PS5 and have the TV turn on with it, so I preferably don't want to turn of CEC all together. Is there a solution for this or should I just turn of CEC? Thank you!"

For instance I played FNaF on my PS4, now inserting the same disc in my PS5, it gives me the option to install either the PS4 or the PS5 version, which begs the question why I should install the PS4 version..... My old savegames are unavailable on the PS5 version. Long story short: How can I have my PS4 savefiles on my PS5? (I tried the ps+ cloud, it says synchronized but safefiles are not there) and do they actually give me a free PS5 digital version, meaning I don't have to put in the disc everytime?"

Horizon Forbidden west is longer most probably if considering only the cutscenes and total events that occur in the main storyline whereas Elden ring¬† story is shorter a little if you don‚Äôt do anything extra and get the 2 great runes only do the main questline so the rating according to the story of both : **Horizon 9.2 Elden ring 9.1 and remember the 2 stories are of different categories** one is fantasy future world and one is fully new fantasy world and one uses technology improvements and new AI‚Äôs whereas the other is based on becoming the Elden Lord and runes and great runes and both containing some interesting twists and in ELDEN RING you can change the ending whereas it‚Äôs not possible in HFW but you can change alloy‚Äôs personality and choices and be bold ,smart or kind are hear about everyone‚Äôs views and stories . for more [visit](https://whyconsole.com/2022/03/19/horizon-forbidden-west-vs-elden-ring-honest-personal-review/) and I mention there more good ones for 2022"

Therefore, in the short term, we're going to be allowing sales number posts for *current-gen titles and consoles only*.  So the ever-popular Elden Ring and console sales threads would remain, but stuff like the latest numbers for RDR2 or The Witcher would go.

We feel this is a reasonable compromise, and we'll see what the sub looks like after this change and go from there."

First one is simple. How long do invites last? As in an invite to join a multiplayer game. I know they expire if the person who sent it creates a new lobby but I am wondering how long it takes for them to just time out. 

Second one has to do with disc games and is a bit specific. If I have a PS4 and a PS5, and let‚Äôs say I have a PS4 disc game installed on both, and I want to buy another copy of the same PS4 game, can I play the installed file simultaneously as long as a game disc is in both or does it have to be the one specific disc because it‚Äôs somehow coded into the console for it to run the file? Again, assuming I have two game discs for the exact same game.

1,"how is deathloop and or dying light 2? or any other titles worth playing? Personally neither of these games shout to me ""I gotta play them!"" I've beaten Elden Ring, replayed it more times than I care to admit. Horizon was a one and done for me.. recently replayed Diablo 2

I can only replay the games in my library so many times and im hoping theres some hidden gem i dont know about and hopefully you know. 

Personally I've replayed all the bioshocks, resident evils, fallout 4, 76, all the dark souls, sekiro, rdr2 got, days gone, the last of us 1 &amp; 2, hitman (all of them) some star wars games (wasn't really a fan but the Jedi one was great.) Also middle earth 1 &amp; 2.

For perspective, I really would like to own all the PS5 exclusives as that is mainly what I bought it for. All other games I use my XSX. On the other hand, in the past I have played the Dishonored games and while I do enjoy them and think they are quite fun they were also always way to challenging for me to where I just lost interest in playing them maybe a 1/4-1/3 through. I have never played Prey so can't speak on that. But what I see of Deathloop and the whole idea of it has me to believe it would probably be a 9 or 10 game for me that I would actually finish.

So in your opinions how do you think it compares to their other titles in this aspect and do you think it is worth me giving a shot for the price tag currently?

Pros and cons of the game are all welcome too.

Thanks."

The agent confirmed, but said that I will be NOTIFIED of early access to PS5 restocks and Walmart deals, but will not actually be able to PURCHASE anything through early access until I have already been a member for at least 30 days. He said the access notifications are triggered by your membership purchase but there is essentially a waiting period to buy anything through it.

Is this true? The member benefits FAQs and other info on their site doesn't say anything about such limitations. I am hoping he just made a mistake?"

1,"Speculated Weapons in God of war Ragnar√∂k and date of release  There is not much information available as to what weapons we‚Äôll be seeing in the new game, but as usual, speculations fueled by the God of war Ragnar√∂k trailer released by the Santa Monica team have been flying around. There are also a few speculations that were motivated mainly by Norse mythology.

**Leviathan Ax** ‚Äî This weapon which we first saw in God of War (2018), is making a comeback in the new series. Kratos wields it by flinging it and calling it back, holding his arm out just like Thor‚Äôs hammer. This video shows it in action.

 

**Gungnir** ‚Äî This weapon, also known as ‚ÄúThe swaying one‚Äù is a special spear used by Odin who made an appearance in God of war Ragnar√∂k. We‚Äôve heard rumours of Kratos claiming Gungnir for himself after defeating Odin in the game.

**Laevateinn** ‚Äî The wand-like weapon which is said to manipulate enemies from a distance. Although Kratos is not one to cast spells, the character who always resorts to using his muscles to fight his way out of any problem may use this weapon in the new game. Some have described this speculation as proof of how mature and refined the new Kratos character will be in God of war Ragnar√∂k.

One thing is for sure. The wait will be worth it. How do we know this? Cory Barlog, a producer on the team, on his Twitter page, celebrated the fourth anniversary of the critically-acclaimed God of War (2018). He also assured fans that his team is full of perfectionists who will stop at nothing to give us the best. That‚Äôs a bold statement considering how difficult it will be to deliver something better than the previous god of war games."
1,"Aiming / Shooting with a controller: how did you get used to it? I'm terrible at aiming / shooting with the controller. I recently bought a PS5 and some of the games I'm more excited to try involve shooting, like Cyberpunk and Deathloop.

In the PS4, I abandoned Fallout 4 pretty early on, because I couldn't shoot and I kept dying every time I was attacked. I wanted to play it because I really liked Fallout 3 on the PC (I don't have a PC right now, PS5 is my only gaming option.)

I finished The Last of Us 1 with great effort and didn't like the experience because of how bad I am at shooting. So I'm not even considering playing TLOU2. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time, but I played it with auto-aim. If it's available, I'll use auto-aim (Uncharted, Tomb Raider, RDR2).

But some games don't have the option for auto-aiming. I've watched some youtube videos, but even those seem to be directed to people who are not as bad as I am.

What should I do? Do you think I should play a pure shooter, something free like Apex Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, to improve until I feel comfortable enough to enjoy the single player games that involve shooting? How did you guys get used to aiming / shooting with a controller?"

1,"It‚Äôs really remarkable how many games Sony is selling. I just checked how many games alone the Ps4 has sold til 2022 and it blew me away. More than double that of the switch with similar hardware sales, Ps5 is doing also extremely well. And everything with offering free titles per month, Ps now etc and being a mature system with barely casual games. 

Their strategy is right. Period. They don‚Äôt need whatever people say they need."
1,"Sony will be, one day, one of the richest companies in the world, thanks to Virtual Reality and gaming Today, VR is only a small branch on a much bigger gaming tree. But one day, the metaverse will be reality and VR devices small and light. The metaverse sounds like a sci fi nightmare when Facebook is talking about it but in reality it‚Äôs basically social media 2.0. 

And imagine having then the best VR games and affordable technology. 

Microsoft is right when they say that there are 2 billion potential gamers out there. But you won‚Äôt reach them with Gamepass. Not even a Tv app available everywhere can reach 300 million. Not even the casual toaster also known as switch will achieve that. You need something that everybody wants. Like a phone. And VR combined with social media will one day be such a thing. Especially as soon as they are able to combine VR with phones and metaverse. 

Sony are not dumb and have an incredible sense for that. Alone how they changed the camera market on their own was brilliantly."
1,"Why I think, A Ps5 handheld would have been better investment than VR First context: 

People love to compare hardware sales. And it looks like, the switch will be one day the best selling system of all time. 

But! It‚Äôs not that simple. It not only matters how many you have sold but in what time. The switch will very likely exist til 2027 (because one of their leaders said it‚Äôs only at half of the life cycle atm). 

Nintendo Switch is the only money source for Nintendo. While Microsoft makes a lot and will even make a lot more money, from Pc as well. Sony moving to pc as well means that it‚Äôs better to have 2 money sources than 1. Because they have seen that pc and console gamers are completely different species ü§£. Not to forget that Microsoft will overall become a service brand not just a hardware based brand. 

It‚Äôs also important what kind of system the Switch is. The switch has basically no competition. While Microsoft has Sony and Sony has Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft make mostly games for mature people and core gaming while switch makes casual games for everybody (mostly). 

Yes is a difference and significant if you make a system for families or hardcore gamers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Nintendo Switch Games can even be played by non gamers. Like mobile games. That‚Äôs what makes it so successful. But Imo, their games are mediocre at best (Mario and Zelda excluded). 

Their games are basically low budget titles my grandma can play why she is on her way with the bus. There is nothing wrong about that, but for the same reason the most successful movies, YouTube videos, games are family or casual products, for the same reason the switch is more successful than other brands. At least hardware wise. 

The Wii was stronger than Ps3 and Xbox 360 but sold much less games per console. Many people buy their systems for maximal 3 games (statistic). While for example ps3/4 had a 9-12 ratio. 

Many YouTubers and news outlets will just say System A sold better than System B, ignoring time, audience, software etc.

And here comes my point which has nothing to do with statics and math: 

I believe that Sony should start producing games like crash, spyro (of course new brands since Microsoft bought them, or will) etc again and then port those games to handhelds. Or just make handheld versions of them. Their studios often are working on 2-3 games at the same time. Why not letting them work on 1 casual and 1 core game? Ratchet, Sackboy would have been amazing casual on the go games. Even Returnal, a core game, would have been cool on the go. Sure, ratchet would not had the ssd trick with the rifts but imo, games can live without that as well. PlayStation has also an amazing lineup of old games which also would fit perfectly on a handheld. 

I know you think I just desperately want a Handheld and you‚Äôre right ü§£. Sony is wasting a huge potential here. Letting Nintendo dominate the market with underwhelming games just because there is nothing else. And no, Valves console is too big, too core, has no exclusives. It‚Äôs not a real competition. After the hype it will die out pretty soon. Will 100% not sell 100 million pieces lol. 

Anyway, let me know what you think."

1,"PS5 Disk Edition or Digital Edition for Birthday Gift? Hi everyone! I'll keep this short.

I am not a console person, mostly PC and occasionally my Switch. My partner's birthday in June and I'd like to get him a PS5 that he's been wanting. Would it be better to get my partner a Disk edition of the PS5 or the Digital Edition? He is also a big PC gamer and doesn't like the clutter of disks, but before I go on this journey of trying to hunt one down I'd like to know which one is more favored/the better option.

Thank you!"
1,"Black screening So i just got a brand new 70"" vizio M6 series qled tv. I had been playing on my monitor 27"" lg ultra gear 165 hz for a while now with no issues. I wanted to try it on the new tv in 4k at 60 hz just because i never experienced it before. I hooked it up to the tv and worked fine the first day.. the 2nd day worked fine, the 3rd day i started up the game was hust messing around on vanguard zombies trying to level some guns up and after i clicked start match I notice my screen went black, i wiggled the hdmi very gently on the back of my ps5 and the picture came back on played for that night. The next day i booted up the game and nothing but black screen tried different hdmi inputs on my tv and still nothing, unplugged hdmi from my tv and put it back into my monitor and it works just fine... ? Whst is going on?"

That Super Sonic's final story's final boss was easy I had goosebumps! Even though it was a DX port (or DX remake) from the PC version it's all the same with or without the DX DLC upgrade! I had to record videos on my phone of Amy running to Sonic before She gives Him the emerald with and without subtitles! Amy's Story is short but I had to keep Her with that save file I have! I have to let go of the analog stick to stop Amy from sprinting (the one with the hammer) or I can press the action button to stop it to a hammer attack halt! The Chao races are fun when you take good care of the Chao in Chao Garden! Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are the ones I beat since I stopped playing it on a PS3 a decade ago! But when I come back to playing it on PSNow, boy I sure had a blast playing it! Amy's boots are rounded instead squared and I like them when She does alot of gameplay and cutscene animations from Her boots! I'm never gonna stop playing that game again! I can play it forever and ever and never stop! After I beaten the whole game I said ""So long Sonic Adventure on PSNow, bye."" and turned off the PS5! I really sure enough had a blast! Can't wait for Sonic Origins to come out next month.

I know Guardians is supposed to be excellent, and is actually full price now at $59...is it worth grabbing the bundle for the cheaper price or waiting til GOG goes on sale on its own?

And just how bad is Avengers? Is it at least a fun play through with buddies?

I hate how every time I go into an app it has to adjust the television again. I just want the home screen of the PS5 not to be in high dynamic range so that it only converts when I actually go into a game that uses it.

Is there any way to do that?"

1,"Update on LG OLED B8 to C9 conversion Not long ago I created a Post about converting an OLED B8 TV to C9 by just swapping out the main board, WiFi module, and the magic remote.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg\_oled\_b8\_can\_be\_converted\_to\_a\_c9\_model\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg_oled_b8_can_be_converted_to_a_c9_model_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Now that I did the conversion I would like to give you an update:

1. **Getting the parts**  
This was actually easy. I searched eBay for those parts and ordered those which were the cheapest including shipping. 
2. **Preparation**  
I had to clean the new main board because it had metal flakes on the back. I guess the Italian workshop it came from is about recycling defective TV's and reselling parts. I did this with Isopropanol alcohol and a soft brush. I rinsed the main board with alcohol and then brushed off the metal flakes and residue. Only make sure to not flush out the cooling paste, but reapplying new one should not be an issue.   
Before doing the installation i factory reset my B8 TV in case I want to resell the main board and WiFi module, I would like to prevent someone else logging into my accounts.
3. **Installation**  
Literally all I needed was a Philipps PH1 screw driver. I recommend getting one with a magnetic tip. The hardest part was getting the back cover off, which is attached with clips to the rest of the TV. Then I had to remove all ribbon cables from the main board, unscrew it, replace it with the C9 main board, and put back the ribbon cables. Just make sure you unlatch the data cables properly and avoid ripping the off or ripping out the ribbon cable connectors. Replacing the WiFi module required unscrewing the whole fixture. The new WiFi module is smaller but fits perfectly well into the fixture. The new main board fit perfectly and all connectors are the same and in the same place.   
Worth noting: Since the (at least mine) B8PLA model already had a headphone jack, I din't need to unsolder it nor did I need to cut out a square hole into the back cover.
4. **Setup**  
After connecting the network, power, and HDMI cables I turned on the TV and it immediately greeted me in Italian language. I realized that the remote which came with my B8 model still works, but I used the new one since I already got it. Not sure if some functions won't work. Then it took me a little while change the language to English.   
First thing I did is factory reset the TV. I had to enter a 4 digit code to do so. My first guess 1111 worked, but after resetting the 4 digit code is actually 0000.  Setting up the TV was easy, and I immediately realized that it's faster.
5. **Testing with PS5**  
First the good news. PS5's screen settings info showed that 120Hz at 4K are supported and VRR is supported within a range of 48-120 Hz. 4K@120Hz works without an issue.  
Now the bad news. In Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition when testing at 4K 120 Hz with VRR on (aka Instant Game Response on C9) I had a black screen. In Ratchet and Clank I had partially a black screen. Not sure why this is. I would be interested if anyone else is having the same experience with their original C9 models.  


**TL/DR:** Converting my 55B8PLA to a 55C9MLB model was quite easy. Contrary to my previous post, I did not need a new remote. 4K@120Hz works but I am having black frames or completely black screen with VRR on.   


I will update this article if anything changes (e.g. after a PS5 or C9 update, or if I experience any issues)."

However I really did not like assasins creed and I‚Äôm curious if Elden going to be similar. I found AC very slow and drawn out at times. The fighting felt machanical and repetitive. I get alittle bored with hand to hand combat games as opposed to shooters so maybe that‚Äôs part of it. I‚Äôve just heard so many good things about Elden and want to give it a shot but don‚Äôt want to end up the same way I did with AC. Any input from the masses?"

1,"Slight Delay on Physical Copies of SRG Deaths Door Hi¬†

You're receiving this email because you ordered DEATH'S DOOR from Special Reserve Games. We are just emailing you to inform you of a small delay; no action is necessary from you.

Over the last year we have been working to improve our warehouse operation, and bring as much of it in-house as possible. Right now, we are assembling DEATH'S DOOR Switch Reserves, and will be shipping them soon. Switch Singles will begin shipping on Monday.

We are seeing a delay on the PS5 games, which have to be assembled by Sony. We will be shipping Switch games shortly but we expect that PS5 games will experience a shipping delay of a couple of weeks. We still hope to be shipping them this month, but it's possible we might end up shipping them in the first week of June.

Many of the earliest orders for this game included both Switch and PS5 games. For these customers, we have set aside low-numbered Switch games to be packaged into their shipments later on when the PS5 games are ready to ship.

We just wanted to let you know this, and update everyone who ordered the game on its progress. Here are a few pics from the assembly floor. We're really pleased how the game name and Sarge's seal turned out!"

Can you legitimately own RDR2 for free when you have the next tier after Essential? And all the other games in the tier? Is it like PS+ Collection? That you sub to PS+ and get access to those games?

Is there a reason this game is so hard to get?

1,"Ubisoft+ vs Ubisoft+ Classics I see a lot of people misunderstanding these two services, so I will try to put it in simpler words.
From Ubisoft News: https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/bPREDsvbMwS7wKIHlnVF1/ubisoft-coming-to-playstation 
&gt; Ubisoft+ will come to PlayStation in the future, bringing access to more than 100 titles, additional content packs, and rewards to the platform. The subscription service is currently available on PC, Stadia, and Amazon Luna, offering players day-one releases, classic games, and premium editions, and ultimately will be available on PlayStation and Xbox.

So, Ubisoft+ that's currently available on PC, Stadia and Luna will be coming to PlayStation store as a separate subscription service that will probably cost the same as on PC (15$). What's revealed today is a new Ubisoft+ subscription ""tier"" that's included with PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium.
&gt; Ubisoft also revealed that beginning May 24, it will launch a **new** Ubisoft+ subscription for PlayStation Plus called Ubisoft+ Classics. Ubisoft+ Classics on PlayStation is a **curated selection** of popular games, including top-selling Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla, The Division, and For Honor, as well as beloved classic games like Child of Light, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Watch Dogs, Werewolves Within, and more. The Ubisoft+ Classics catalogue for PlayStation Plus will launch with **27 titles and will grow to 50 by the end of 2022**

It will have 27 titles at launch and will expand to 50 by the end of the year. It won't have new releases (at least for now, we will have to wait), probably no DLCs too. We don't know if they will add new games after half or full year like EA+ on gamepass does as they don't state it anywhere (again, gotta wait). 

TLDR: Ubisoft+ with all new releases and DLCs is separate from PS+; Ubisoft+ Classics is included with PS+, but has 27 (later 50) older games."

1,"Background static/hissing/white noise coming from headphones wired into Dualsense I just purchased a PS5 and when using headphones wired into the Dualsense there is a feint hissing/white noise whenever there is audio. If there is no audio then it's completely silent, so it's not a constant background noise. And if I turn the headphone volume down in the PS5 menu all the way to zero you can still hear the white noise. 

I have tried 3 different headphones and I have just got the store I bought the PS5 from to replace the Dualsense and the same issue. Also I don't get this noise when using a PS4 pad.

Is it mean to be like this or do I have a faulty PS5? The best way to test is to just by being on the home screen and navigating around. Turn off home screen music but leave on sound effects.

I don't want to send back my PS5 for an exchange if this is just the way it is meant to be.

Just got the a80j in 77‚Äù screen size about a week ago and have been trying to use it with my ps5 but keep getting issues with sound and video.

I‚Äôll first explain the display area glitch. There are times where part of the video signal from the ps5 is cut off on the right or left side but the opposite side has just dead space‚Ä¶ just pixels that are turned off. Only way I have found to fix it is doing a hard restart of the tv. Restarting the PS5 did nothing in my case.

Now for the sound glitch. I have a Denon 3300 AVR but chose against using it because of how much sound lag there is with it. Problem is that if my PS5 is on and I try to switch my sound from external to internal tv speakers it introduces about 100ms of sound lag. So then I have to go into my ps5 sound settings and change it from PCM to DTS and then back to PCM. This reduces the sound lag coming from the tv speakers from about 150ms back down to 50ms. I can‚Äôt seem to figure out if it‚Äôs something with the ps5 or the TV that is causing this issue. 

Also why is there any lag at all when my ps5 is plugged directly into the tv, so the sound from the tv speakers should have zero delay but it still has about 50ms? Any input to enlighten me is very welcome. Thank you in advance"

1,"Is the Canadian GameStop extended warranty worth it? I recently bought a PS5 disc version at GameStop, they offered me the extended warranty but I wasn't sure. The sales clerk said if I change my mind I can come back, bring the receipt within 14 days of purchase and add it on. 

My question is, should I do that? I added the warranty on the controller because of all the issues I've seen on YouTube. I believe it's $120 Canadian for 2 years of direct replacement. Although, there might be some wait currently because of stock issues. 

I don't know what to do."

1,"PS5 Remote Play/IPad First time using remote play and it is AWESOME.  No lag, worked perfectly, setup perfectly, etc.  Only problem I had was disconnecting.

1,"disc copies still expensive So I'm just wondering when do games actually go on a decent sale - mainly talking about ghost of Tsushima here. 

It's ¬£70 for a digital copy of it and it's around ¬£55 for a disc copy on Amazon. I checked used copies and it's around ¬£40-50. So I'm just wondering does this game ever go on sale? It's been out for like 2 years(?) And it's still being sold next to full price pretty much. But there's other games that have been released for around the same time and are now less than ¬£20 (AC Valhalla). Why is that? 

I remember before I used to buy new copies for ¬£40 on release and now I can barely get a used copy for that much depending on the game even a year or two later. I know there's a lot of factors that go into it but it kinda sucks."

Very recently, two days ago I was playing DayZ with my pals.

I came home yesterday from work only for my PlayStation to turn on, but not connect to the TV.

Basically, it works properly, but the video isn't showing. I reused my PS4 HDMI cable and it didn't work. I used two different TVs in the house and it didn't connect either.

1,"got a ps5 today n got to say i was blown away by the most unlikely game.... been gaming for over 30 years from the high profile arcades, from my first ever machine the spectrum zx sinclare and everything since,  sorta been shoe horned into the xbox family since the 360 purely because the ps3 got delayed so much , when i did eventually get a ps3 i was very underwhelmed, the ps4 iv had for a while and always been impressed with the exclusives, i stood by my guns and said (being an mainly an xbox gamer) that nothing on the alternate consoles looked even as good as infamous 2nd son....

&amp;#x200B;

iv gone through every iteration of the xbox since the 360, and since the one X was release iv always stood by my own opinion and even owning the series S and X when MS boasts they have the most powerful console available , yes thats all well and good to claim it but show me ..... and iv had both the Series Consoles the S over a year the X since Xmas and they are both nice and shiny but iv missed that new gen feeling, when you upgraded to ps2 and you saw GTA3 for the first time it dropped your jaw, when RDR dropped your brains flew out , when you played mario 64 it was like omfg what is this devilry. but since then iv had nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

today i picked a ps5 up from the most unlikely place and all the way home was like eesh should i have bought this, loaded it up and i had 2 new gen games to impress me, horizon being the game i was expecting to be amazing..... but then the one that never expected anything from at all or even heard of which i instantly fell in love with and not only did i expect nothing from but made me fall back in love with nostalgia and gaming again ......... the astro game...

&amp;#x200B;

It hits every nail on the head, simplistic gaming, charm, amazing sound, the nostalgia of many years of gaming , great graphics, fun gameplay, it just took me back through 30 years of gaming and doesnt try to be anything special or standout it just hits all the basics that so many games miss these days, it looks nice yes but its no nawty dog game or whatever but as someone who has been gaming years upon years and got lost in graphics, or addicted to achievements or whatever other fad has come along , gaming at its heart has become lost for being what its meant to be and thats fun........ this game brought it all back and id say for any developer and especially MS who have tried to shove yukaleele or however its spelled and recore or all this fails mascots down our throats take a note this game blew my mind in ways it shouldnt...

&amp;#x200B;

anways iv waffled enough iv had a beer but yeh any buyers remorse i had instantly went away with this game and even though its a fkin unit of a machine and iv had to build an extension to get it in my house, ps5 has made me do what no console has done in years..... and thats fall in love with it instantly..."

As of a few hours ago, my controller does not seem to detect any (wired) headphones.

Whenever I plug a pair of headphones into my controller, they are simply not detected. I have tried multiple different pairs but none of them seem to work (despite all previously working). When I go to my sound settings, the audio output is still via the HDMI cable - as if no headphones were even detected in the first place.

This is especially annoying because just two weeks ago, I returned my controller to Sony for a repair - it just gave up and stopped working (random inputs, unresponsive buttons etc.). I only received it back a few days ago but everything seemed to be working fine (the only thing I noticed is that pressing touchpad sounded a bit flimsy).

Has anybody else experienced this? Is there a fix or should I just return the controller *yet again*?"

* Does my family member need to sign into my account each time they want to download a game?

(Can they just download them directly from their account once I‚Äôve made my account primary on their console?)



* Will my family member be required to put their own credit card on their own PlayStation account?

(Or will it inherit the credit card from the primary (my) account?)



* Can I password protect my account on their console so they cannot freely access my account?

1,"PS5 hardly read my disc Hi all,

So I have a PS5 with built-in optical drive however I'm usually purchasing games digitally.

Now -after finishing Elden Ring - I've got the idea to play Sekiro again.

I have a physical copy. (This is the first disc I'm trying to insert since I've got the console last may)

So I just inserted the disk, the drive spinned for like 2 seconds and I've got the error that the disc cannot be recognized.

I've tried it again and again.

After a while, I was able to install the game from disc, however, since the installation, the game is not booting and the PS don't recognize the disc again. 

Console is laying horizontally (I've read somewhere that the standing position might cause these issues, it's not the case here)

The disc is near perfect condition, as I've used it only once or twice on PS4 (2-3 hours of game time maximum), I've cleaned it with microfiber tissue, tried to reboot the PS, even from safe mode, rebuild the database, etc... System software is up to date. Nothing seems to help.

What do you think? Has anyone encountered this same issue? 

My biggest concern is, that somehow I was able to install the game from the disc, but before and after, it's non-recognised again.

What do you think, might it be a hardware issue? Dust in the optical drive, etc?"

Pretty much had to since accessing the save file for the mission prior to completing it practically REQUIRED you to have the aforementioned patch installed anyways, as unfortunate as it was to me.

But alas, I went ahead and replay the mission in Kurosawa Mode and as much as I hate to say it, it was quite good at this increased frame rate. Now it's still not a superior experience to the original frame rate on PS4 Pro, mind y'all. But it was a decent enough test run for this game."

Because I've heard that the PS4 games play off the external storage itself and you have to transfer them over to the main storage to play them with the PS5 capabilities/features.

1,"In my (limited) experience, PS5 games look more crisp on a 1080p screen because many don't hit true 4K at 60fps. I've had my PS5 for about a year, and I've been playing it on a 1080p 60hz TV the entire time. The picture is crisp and from the distance I'm at, it looks great!

I took my PS5 to a friend's house that has a 4K TV and the image for a few games I tried was just not as good. It was blurrier in my opinion.

Doing some research since then I'm finding that there aren't that many games that run at a true 4K 60 on the PS5. Many are checkerboard or dynamic resolution which doesn't quite hit 4K, or they're 1440p at their performance mode. Often the quality mode is native 4K but runs at 30fps which I don't like. So many games seem to be upscaled to 4K which doesn't look as good as native and it appears blurry to me after seeing them on a 1080p screen.

Seems like all of this, on a 1080p screen creates a better picture because it's either native resolution or higher and it's downscaled nicely to 1080p.

To play games at 60fps and retain a crisp resolution, seems like upgrading from a 1080p TV isn't really a good idea with this console. Happy to be proven wrong on the technical details of the games, but that's my experience so far.  I'm sure there are well optimized exceptions out there and yes, the performance mode probably makes other visual sacrifices. But I'm talking about purely resolution and FPS as that's what looks ""good"" to my eyes.

I kinda expected more from PS5 but it seems like the trend will be in the direction of more 30fps titles if we want native 4K. Do you think developers will push to optimize for 4k 60 as the console matures, or do you think they'll pack in as much expensive visuals as they can and just cap it at 30?"

I've had the console for quite some time, and this is not the first time it's happened. It's no fluke, being a consistant problem.

I‚Äôve tried every possible troubleshooting solution: changed the cables, checked the HDMI ports, tested on another TV and carried out a hard reset. None of this has worked. 

I‚Äôm also unable to enter safe mode. When I hold the power button down for 7 seconds the screen remains black, as if there‚Äôs no input. 

Weirdly, I managed to access safe mode once and changed my HDR settings, but that didn‚Äôt work either. I‚Äôve not able to access safe mode since. It seems that one time was a total fluke.  

Also, my controller won‚Äôt turn on. This surely can‚Äôt be an unrelated issues, but it doesn‚Äôt even charge when I plug it into the wall. It just flashes orange once and then turns off. 

Has anyone else had similar issues? I‚Äôm thinking that I must have a faulty model. It‚Äôs just strange to have these problems with a brand-new console."

Having stated the games scope was too large to release alongside the single player, it wouldn‚Äôt be wild to assume they‚Äôre going to attempt to capitalise on the popular larger scale multiplayer games of recent.

Core systems like mobility, looting, combat etc. are already in place to compliment something like a Battle Royale or Tarkov experience.

Do you think they‚Äôll follow the curve or just expand on what they already have with Factions?"
1,issues when playing my PS5 Hey guys I'm currently having issues when on my ps5 seems to be happening alot so I bought a new gaming TV and I hooked my ps5 up to it and for some reason sometimes I get hdmi signal lost then two seconds later I get hdmi signal received. I don't know what causing this as it only happens if for example I click on destiny and as it loads up I get hdmi signal lost then recieved or in a middle of a game the same thing happens. It doesn't happen often but just randomly however everytime I load up destiny before the sign in screen it always happens any help would be amazing thank you.

1,"Console sharing is OP on PS4/PS5s Me and my cousin who also owns a PS5 pretty much split all of our video game purchases through file sharing and bought insurgency sandstorm awhile back.

1,"My fellow sports games fans, which of the upcoming soccer games are you most excited for? So, by now, we know that we are entering a pretty wild and weird time for fans of the beautiful game. For years now, soccer games have been almost exclusively just FIFA and PES. Both required the yearly $60ish investment for mostly a roster update and maybe a couple new features and gameplay upgrades.

In the (hopefully near) future, we the gamers will have at least 5 new games to choose from! Those games will be EA Sports FC, FIFA's rival to EASFC, eFootball, UFL and GOALS. The latter 3 are/will be free to play which I assume that EASFC and its rival will continue to do yearly releases at a $60ish price point.

Personally, I've already given up on FIFA, so EASFC and it's rival aren't for me. I'm excited to see where these other companies choose to take the idea of a soccer game. It will be very interesting to see what sort of features, animations, game modes, etc get included in order to give each game its own unique feel.

eFootball is already available for free and while it's definitely rough around the edges (and there honestly isn't very much content right now) it's a nice change of pace from what FIFA is. Over time I'm sure it'll get even better to compete with FIFA, at least in the short term.

All that being said, I just wanted to find out which of these y'all are most excited for. For me, it's GOALS! On paper, they seem to have a ridiculously cool concept and I think if they manage to pull it off and simultaneously deliver a game that feels satisfying to play, then they'll run away with the market. If you haven't already, definitely check them out to see what sort of ideas they're wanting to bring to the table! Share your thoughts on how you think the soccer game landscape will change in the coming months/years!"

Are they trying some new marketing strategy?

1,"TLOU pt1 is one of the best role playing games ever, in the truest sense of the word. I love an action RPG. I finished the mass effect trilogy. I saw my choices affect the final outcome. I finished the Fallout games, Witcher, Skyrim, Diablo, Outer Worlds, all the Soulsborne games and many more action RPG's. I enjoyed them all but I never felt like there was an emotional weight behind my choices and actions, I never truly felt like I was *playing the role* of the main character. 

By the last act of TLOU pt1 I realised I felt something I hadn't experienced before in a video game - I *really cared* what happened to Ellie. I felt a weight of responsibility I couldn't explain.  I don't know if it's down to the brilliant writing, pacing and voice acting or something else, but no other game has truly made me feel like the decisions I made as the the main character really *mattered* like this one did. 

I think sometimes when you're creating something you can very occasionally stumble upon a magical combination that is far greater than the sum of it's parts, and Naughty Dog caught lightning in a bottle with the way they constructed Joel and Ellie's unfolding relationship.

This is why my truest 'role playing' experience to date came from an action adventure game that isn't even technically an RPG."

Better graphics, sure, and 60 fps ain‚Äôt bad either. I mean, just look at some of the games made on the ps4. Last of us 2 (wether you hate it or not) has some of the best animation in gaming. Bloodborne, Horizon zero dawn, God of war, Ghost of tsushima, Control, and Spiderman were also  great games on the ps4. Really, if the best performance dictated wether a game was good or not Im sure there would be pc exclusive games. Heck, look at Nintendo. Their games have the worst performance out of the consoles yet, they make some of the greatest games to date. Maybe theres something Im missing something, but cross generational titles arent holding the ps4 back."

Also I know that all my Aussie bought PS5 games will work on the console when I bring it over, as well UK PS5 bought games. But will I be able to buy DLC in the UK for UK bought PS5 games? Or purchase DLC for my Aussie bought PS5 games in the UK? I know you can't change your PSN region so I know I'll be still functioning under the AUS store. But I just want to know that I will be fine buying UK PS5 games and to be able to download stuff for those games (or any other apps from the store) whilst living in the UK.

All and all, will my PS5 function in the UK if bought in Australia? And will I be able to download DLC for UK bought PS5 games. Essentially will my PS5 function identically as it does in Australia?

1,"Replacement Instead of Repair? My PS5 sent got received by Sony for repairs for the second time for the same exact issue. It seems like it had Power Supply issues and used to hard crash or brick within minutes of me playing PS5 titles. I've had the console since Day 1 and it first became faulty and was repaired within 9 months of use.. Then again (now) within 8 months of repair.

I've contacted support and even wrote them a note along with my hardware asking them to please replace my console instead of repairing it since I'm uncertain about the future of my console's lifespan and I didn't want to pay for out of pocket charges for an initially faulty console. Sounds reasonable right? At least I'd hope.

Due to the prevalence of complaints about the drive simply being loud, I've had a hard time finding similar experiences. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Was there any fix you found that worked? 

I've tried opening the machine up and adjusting the drive screw clockwise with a disc in until it is ejected manually. A much shorter/milder version of this noise early on was fixed by that technique, but it doesn't work now.

Unfortunately I'm well outside of warranty. Has anyone had to deal with Sony for an out of warranty fix for their PS5? All my original Sony hardware even back to the PSOne are still running fine, never had to deal with them for repairs."

Now all of my PS5 controllers act weird right after turning them on. It won't react instantly, it will scroll way past where I'm trying to scroll to, then roughly 1 or 2 minutes into this behavior, the controller will disconnect. The weird thing is this started happening to my Nintendo Switch as well. Both consoles are up to date on the consoles and controllers. Nothing new changed about their locations. Nothing else was brought into the house that would interfere with them. The distance at which I play hasn't changed (10-15 feet). Both consoles are out in the open and not closed behind stuff. When I say all controllers are acting weird, this includes the original version PS5 controller, a new controller that was released recently (the purple one), the PS5 media remote, and the joycons for the Switch."

In resolution mode you have the regular unresponsive mess that 30 fps brings, but with a very clear image.

While in the 60fps mode, and arguably the only way to play an action game given the option, looks like a blur 

I wish the developers would design the games in regards to the hardware it‚Äôs launching on. Why push the graphics so much, only to cripple the game play.

Just dial down the fidelity a notch and give us a clear image and 60 fps, which should‚Äôve been the standard going forward with ps5."

1,"PS5 connectivity issues Bought the console back in November and ever since I‚Äôve been having issues with the wifed connection.

I can‚Äôt play Warzone and I keep getting disconnected every 1-2 mins in Elden Ring, it works on Apex, but for it to work, in-game Apex has to say it‚Äôs unable to connect to the internet (Code 100 i think id the error) and then it manages to connect snd work flawlessly from there on.

While downloading I‚Äôve had issues where it sometimes just stops downloading and/or downloads veeeery slowly, but sometimes it downloads flawlessly.

I have two wired connections that I‚Äôve created, let‚Äôs call them 1 and 2, 1 is the wired connection that the Playstation automatically created and 2 is the one that i manually created when i searched my router info on my PC, for instance, 1 works perfectly on Apex but won‚Äôt work on other games, 2 works on other games but won‚Äôt on Apex.

I called my ISP months ago when these issues were first bothering me and they said that they don‚Äôt see any issues and that it‚Äôs probably my PS5‚Äôs fault, i called the shop where i bought the PS5 they told me it probably isn‚Äôt the PS5 that‚Äôs faulty since they didn‚Äôt have anyone return their PS5 because of this issue, *but* some people have already complained about the same thing.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I literally cannot play Warzone, it‚Äôs not able to connect at all, i keeps disconnecting from Elden Ring, but if i connect via Wifi every game works perfectly, which tells me that there obviously is an issue with the wired connection"

With the new expanded PS Plus on the horizon, there have been lots of topics discussing what old-school games people want to see. But I‚Äôm a bit concerned that games from the PS1 era that have voice acting will be difficult for them to get the rights to. 

As I understand it, contracts for voice acting were different back in the day and only provided rights to the voices for a certain amount of time. So if the company wanted to re-release a game now that had voices, they would have to draw up new contracts with the entire voice cast and pay them for usage again. However, I haven‚Äôt used PS Now before, so I was curious: Are there any PS1 games currently on the service that have voice acting?"

I got my PS5 in February of 2021, and as of April 2022 my DualSense is completely unusable. The first issue popped up around 6 months in when something snapped in my right trigger that caused the trigger to become very loose and sensitive to even the slightest amount of pressure. This was annoying, but it didn't seem to effect the adaptive trigger functionality and ultimately I got used to dealing with it. A couple months later, the same thing happened to the left trigger.

The biggest issue began this year when the dreaded stick drift started to kick in on the right stick. It started off pretty mild but it's progressed to the point now where it's so severe that I am totally incapable of playing any game that uses the right stick. Keep in mind that I take extremely good care of all of my tech. I cleaned the DualSense regularly, never played rough with it and never even dropped it, and the amount of time that I regularly used it would be considered moderate to low by most standards.

I am fairly disappointed that the ""future of gaming controllers"" has barely lasted me a year of use. This stings even more considering that my launch Dualshock 3 still works perfectly."

1,"What let PS Now down? With the new PS Plus service rolling out soon, I was just wondering what caused PS Now to be so poorly received. 

It did have a good collection of games, but was let down by the streaming. MK9 for instance is unplayable due to the latency and lag even on a super fast connection. &amp; since it's a PS3 game it can't be downloaded. 

Downloaded games are great and work like a charm, but only being able to stream games that were older than the PS3 kinda sucks, although understandable.

Very few 1st party games come on PS Now, and only recently have they started to join the service at all. However I really don't see this as a bad thing as it keeps the quality of the games high (most anyway). Adding Returnal is honestly very generous of them. 

The thing is, I don't see many things changing with the new PS Plus Premium service. PS3 games still won't be downloadable, streaming will most likely still be crap and won't be improved any time soon, and there'll be a lack of 1st party games (which is honestly what I prefer, but others will understandably argue against it). 

The addition of PS5 games will help a lot, but people who weren't interested in PS Now previously, most likely won't be after either (excluding everyone who's converting to years of PS Plus Premium for a few quid lol)"

1,"Can anyone comment on the 3D audio performance of the Pulse and Arctis 7P? I'm pretty interested in the PS5's 3D audio feature. I've been comparing headphones, and it seems like the general consensus is that the Arctis is better for almost everything (comfort, build quality, sound). But I can't find any reviews or comments compare the 3D audio feature for the headphones or say that one has better 3D over the other. Has anyone who has tried both noticed any difference in the 3D audio?

I've also read that apparently any headphones will have 3D audio for PS5, but I have a decent pair of Sennheiser headphones for music that I plug into the 3.5mm jack on the controller, but I don't notice anything special. It just sounds like regular old stereo, and I can really only distinguish either left or right, nothing for behind or in front. I have the 3d audio option on in the settings menu, and I've tried out the various customization settings. Is 3D audio just marketing hype?

Thanks!"

1,"The Last of Us 2 I finished this game probably a few months ago and I was reading some reviews and interpretations of the game, and I came to discover that I seem to be in the minority. I loved the Last of Us. The storytelling is fantastic, the gameplay is beautiful, and the world immersive. If given a choice at the end, to sacrifice Ellie or to save her, then I would choose to save her every time! If I was stuck in an apocalyptic environment like their world, and the only semblance of joy in life was a relationship rekindled by and with a child, then I would never let that go, not for the whole world. The Last of Us 2 presented a very reasonable series of consequences for Joel‚Äôs choice in the first game, but I just can‚Äôt seem to care or root for Abby. I don‚Äôt support her or anything about she tries to accomplish. I understand that the writer‚Äôs intention was to display the cycle of violence and voracious appetite of vengeance, but as an audience member of the first game, I was essentially born into the family of Joel and Ellie. Seeing my cherished characters suffer at the hands of a stranger, and then being forced to sympathize with that stranger left me with distaste. Even if it meant destroying hundreds of others‚Äô lives, I would never sacrifice my family for a potential cure to the plague. I would choose violence every time. 

What are your thoughts?"

1,"Are PS5 Discs Getting Thinner? Certain discs not ejecting, probable cause? Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a bit of a weird question, but I'm having trouble ejecting game discs from my PS5. But the catch is that they're only certain ones and that they're fairly new releases.  


I had an issue a couple weeks ago where FNAF Security Breach wouldn't eject from my console. After many a struggles and confusion from the Playstation support article (and having to eventually grab a second, flatheaded, screwdriver) I was able to get it out. Got everything working fine, put in a couple other games (F1 2021 and Spider Man Miles Morales to be precise) to see if the issue was fixed. Seemed to be fixed, no problem. Neither game had issues ejecting.  


Flash forward to tonight and I'm wanting to play F1 2021. So I go to eject the game that was in the disc drive - which was Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga. Same issue happened with that game as with FNAF a couple weeks back. Well no problem, I just do what I did a couple weeks ago, and it comes out fine. Again I try putting F1 2021 in and ejecting it out to see if my problem has been fixed. It looks like it has because F1 2021 comes out fine.   


For the heck of it, I put Skywalker Saga back in and try to eject it again, only to have a worse issue trying to eject it than I did the first time where I just hear a cranking noise, as if the screw to manually remove the disc was being used. I quick turn off my system and get it so that I can get the game out, and I do, fine and all. So then I get everything working again and try Spider Man again, and it comes out fine.  


So at this point I take out Spider Man and compare it to the Skywalker Saga, and I'm not sure if it's just me, but it almost seems like the Skywalker Saga disc is just a tad bit thinner than the Spider Man disc. Could this be causing any potential issues for disc ejection on the PS5? Or are the discs the same size and I'm just losing my mind?  


TL;DR - Certain discs won't eject from PS5, they *appear* to be thinner. Are they? If so, is that what's causing an issue?"

1,"Only 32gb/s HDMI 2.1 forces vrr to downgrade image quality As the title says, enabling VRR even in just 4k60 hdr is causing a very noticeable &amp; reported quality loss &amp; it isn't due to VRR itself. It's due to bandwidth limitations forcing the ps5 into YCbCr422. As of now I'm unsure if there's more to it such as audio downgrades etc BUT Sony said a while back (I believe on Twitter?) that when/if the HDMI bandwidth became an issue it would or could be fixed. 
Can anyone add to this anything more recently said or indications of time frame or if maybe it can't really be done? RN even 4k120 hdr forces the system to lose image quality without VRR even, never mind that 8k tag on the ps5 üì¶ üôÑ

This is huge for me as buying controllers gets expensive!"
1,"What are some games you have tried to get into multiple times but they just didn‚Äôt click for you? I have a few. Lots of words inbound. 

1.	Dying Light, 3 tries. Furthest I‚Äôve made it was to the 3 air drops or some shit. Something about this game‚Äôs graphics that I just hate. Maybe it‚Äôs the motion blur or something but I can‚Äôt stand it. I also simply don‚Äôt like how underpowered you feel and that the only way to deal with zombies is to run away. Yeah the parkour is cool but I play a zombie game to play with zombies not run around them and ignore them completely. And even when you do fight them, using wooden sticks and a pipe while standing on a car is boring. There‚Äôs a mission early on where you have to beat up some human enemies that stole medicine or some shit. You are so underpowered at this stage that the ONLY way to fight all 7 of them and not immediately die is to run in, punch one of them one or two times, get your ass beat within an inch of your life, run away to regen health, then rinse and repeat until they‚Äôre all dead. Also the controls layout is super obtuse. People keep telling me to stick with it but I can‚Äôt make it more than a few hours before getting bored. 
2.	Death Stranding, 2 tries. Furthest I‚Äôve made it was to the first time you have to steal back stuff from the orange guys I don‚Äôt remember what they‚Äôre called. This makes me sad because I REALLY want to like this game; I enjoy the premise and taking a break from those non-stop action games sounds great but I really hate how the first few hours are basically 95% cutscene and 4% reading about the game and how it works. I know that‚Äôs par for the course with Kojima but still. I enjoy navigating the terrain and the online stuff but it‚Äôs just information overload with how much text pops up in your screen before, during, and after every single delivery and the game makes no effort to explain anything to you other than basic gameplay and even then it does a horrible job. There‚Äôs a part in the beginning where it starts to rain and by this point you know that rain is bad so you want to hide from it. During this delivery, the game very deliberately puts a small cave directly in your path seemingly for you to hide in. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù you think. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just wait here for a bit for the rain to stop.‚Äù WRONG. Turns out that this rain is scripted and will not stop until you keep going and rain does not become a dynamic part of the game until much later. I learned this after sitting in that cave and doing literally nothing for 2 hours while waiting for the rain to stop and upon googling, turns out MANY people did this as well. Not a great start. The UI is a mess and packed with information that‚Äôs difficult to parse. And the acting/script is just bad. Very bad. Maybe this was acceptable years ago but we‚Äôre in a post TLOU, GoW era of gaming. Shitty acting and mediocre dialogue in a top-tier AAA game is just not acceptable anymore ESPECIALLY in a game that has the cast that DS does. 
3.	Final Fantasy 15, 3 tries. Furthest I got was to the boat/beach after fixing the car. I‚Äôm not an FF guy and 15 was the first one I ever played. This shit sucks. How fucking lame is it that you can‚Äôt drive the car and it‚Äôs on-rails? The combat feels so outdated and‚Ä¶ airy? It feels like you‚Äôre hitting enemies with a feather and they hardly even react to what you do to them. Magic feels like ass, the AI for enemies and your homies doesn‚Äôt do shit, the quests are boring as hell. Dialogue and acting is just horrendous. I realize again this is typical for these games but somehow FF7 Remake is exactly the same but still manages to be miles better in this regard? That game I didn‚Äôt finish but that‚Äôs because I got distracted with TLOU2 and I‚Äôve been meaning to go back to it. 
4.	Horizon Zero Dawn, furthest I got was about 2-3 hours in. Let me start by saying the game itself isn‚Äôt bad. What I don‚Äôt like about it is the Ubisoft-style open world. I HATE games that litter your map with a bunch of shit to do. If Elden Ring had done this I would not have played it but it didn‚Äôt and that simple change makes exploring and doing quests so much more gratifying. I just can‚Äôt stand a game that throws a bunch of what are basically checkboxes for you to do and doesn‚Äôt let you organically discover them or complete quests, again like Elden Ring. I also hate games that force you to forage for crafting materials to make weapons and ammo types and all that and HZD does exactly this. Again, Elden Ring is the gold standard here. You don‚Äôt NEED to do it but if you want to, just walk over to the thing and press triangle and that‚Äôs it. No long ass animation, no 2-3 dialogue boxes to get through, no annoying sounds or anything, just press the button and get the thing. It‚Äôs funny because my GF just beat this game and she loves it. I can‚Äôt bring myself to play it, it feels like a chore. Which sucks because it looks beautiful and the gameplay itself is superb. It‚Äôs everything else leading up to the gameplay that I don‚Äôt like. 
5.	Red Dead Redemption 2, 2 tries. Furthest I got was  rescuing that one dude from the small prison somewhere in Valentine? This game man, I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt play it. Your dude feels so HEAVY and slow to do anything. That‚Äôs literally the only thing that stops me. I can‚Äôt stand taking 3 years just to turn around or get on your horse or harvest a deer you just killed or loot a building or dead body. I can‚Äôt do it. I realize that‚Äôs the appeal of the game, the immersion and the slow pace and all that but for me, it doesn‚Äôt work. I wish this game had an ‚Äúimpatient mode‚Äù where it would just cut out all those animations and deliberate wait times and just instantly do the thing. Then I‚Äôd be able to play it. Other than that, 10/10 for everything else. I really want to experience the seemingly amazing story but I cannot bring myself to wait for the hours of animations to get there. 
6.	Warzone. These types of games are lame without friends and I don‚Äôt have a consistent squad. And trying communicate with people in pubs is just a horrible experience. People are either rude, annoying, bad teammates, or shit at the game. I‚Äôve not had 1 single positive experience playing with randoms. I really want to play this and be into Warzone but again all my friends are on Fortnite and while I enjoy that too, sometimes I want a different BR experience. Side note: Fortnite no-build more is actually amazing. 

That‚Äôs everything. I‚Äôm bored at work so yeah lol what do y‚Äôall think? What games have you tried to play that just didn‚Äôt work for you?"

Although the sound was low, I could feel the haptics but the sound was very low. I figured out that I could then plug my headphones into the controller to hear the sound and experience the haptics. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but when I plugged it in was it using the actual haptics of the controller rather than the generic rumble?

1,"Are variable or ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù resolution modes possible? When I‚Äôm playing Horizon and get into **combat**, I turn on **60fps** and turn off fidelity 4K mode. 

When I‚Äôm playing Uncharted Remastered, I play 60fps performance mode, but stop to change all **cinematics** to **4k30fps**.

If feasible, I hope the next step for developers will be providing variable modes for those with the screens that can utilize the enhancement.

However, for some I understand there could be irritation from the switching. Also. some games let you pause to change the resolution and some need a restart, so I‚Äôm not sure how much of a challenge this could be. 

Imagine playing Horizon and exploring in 4k30 and then when a combat begins, you go back to the variable4k60fps combat. I‚Äôm sure there could even be a ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù when the game knows you are leaving combat for good or may run into encounters again quickly. 

It could help reduce the suddenness of the frame-rate switch. When the games know you‚Äôre going to be exploring a town, it‚Äôs going to make sure it‚Äôs 4k30. If you just left cleared a cave in 1800p/60fps combat, and the next location on your map 100m away isn‚Äôt cleared, it might as well not go back to 4K30fps pretty mode until you‚Äôre really done with the bad guys in the area. 

For cinematics, I‚Äôm surprised this isn‚Äôt always an option. I don‚Äôt know if any of this would work for open word games, but I wanted to get the idea out there for discussion."

1,"Do you think there will ever be true user-progression between a game and it's sequel(s)? I'll use the Horizon series as an example. Imagine you can import your HZD save data into HFW and it can read what armor, weapons, etc. you had equipped during your last save. Then you start HFW with the same build you had at the end of HZD, even if it's purely cosmetic. It would really feel like you're continuing the same story, playing the same ""version"" of Aloy that you spent all that time with in HZD. I can't be the only one that's sometimes wondered ""why, in this sequel, is the character basically starting back at square 1"" in terms of armor, weapons, skills, etc.

An even deeper idea is if the game is able to tell from the save data which side quests were completed in HZD. Then when meeting the recurring characters in HFW, if you completed their quests in HZD they greet you as an old friend, and if not then they introduce themselves as if they haven't met before. It would really create a unique experience for each individual player based on what they chose to do or not do in the previous game while also making it less immersion-breaking if someone is familiar with the main story but may not have played the first game before jumping into the second. 

Do ya'll think this kind of progression will ever exist? Games can already scan for a different game's save data in general and give items/rewards, so I guess it's more of a question of what data is accessible within the save file itself and if devs can take advantage of that and build it in?"

I'm thinking something in the 2500mah area would be good. I'm hoping I'm not the only one that's done this, and someone could point me in the right direction!"

1,"PS5 Controller Battery Drains Quickly Has anyone have had an issue with the general battery charge on the PS5 controllers? I recently bought a PS5 and the controller is new, the box was sealed, everything is brand new, everything‚Äôs running the latest OS. I have noticed that a single charge doesn‚Äôt last as long as I would have expected.

Now, hear me out ! If I play games that are for PS5 of course the new vibration features, the microphone on, and everything else will drain the battery quickly.

But yesterday, it was fully charged, I muted it, and I was literally just watching something on Netflix, the controller was barely touched for pausing and rewinding, and after three hours I had low battery.

I have only had a PS2 &amp; a PS3, and when I used the PS3 controller the battery lasted for days. I just don‚Äôt know if most users at least are having the same issue, or if this is expected or a normal behaviour even maybe on PS4? Idk‚Ä¶ should I make use of the warranty?

It's enough of an inconvenience that I'm complaining about it.

1,"HDD or SDD? Conflicts in reviews and information I've recently gotten PS5 and I have done quite a bit of research and can't quite narrow it down to exactly how it works. I have a HDD from my PS4, that's a WD Passport 4TB. From what I understand I can easily plug it in to the PS5 and have access to my PS4 games, but what about storing PS5 games on it? 

Do PS5 games only store to SDD? 

If I connect the HDD to the PS5, can I download PS4 games directly to it from the PS Store?

If I was to get a SDD, would it store both PS4 and PS5 games to the same device?

Basically I got the 4TB so I could go all digital with my games esp because of the PS Plus games that drop monthly, I download them whether I play them or not, with now about 100 games on it. I wouldn't mind upgrading to a SDD but I don't want to have to bounce back and forth if I don't have too. Like I said I've done research and get conflicting results with articles that are dated from from the time the PS5 came out and can't seem to find anything about the current status of the HDD/SDD situation so anyone more knowledgeable please chime in.

TIA!!"

1,"This console generation is lame so far I spent 6 months hunting down a PS5 and finally got one in June of 2021. I‚Äôm not sure if I was more excited about getting to play with the new toy or if I was relieved to have secured one, thereby allowing me to close the 24-hour alarm youtube feeds, stop scouting for drops, and quit getting my hopes up and destroyed in morale-crushing online shopping carts. I paid 650 for this sucker, but it came from a very secure source so I felt is was worth the price. I have used it every day for the past year almost, and I maintain that 650 I got my money‚Äôs worth already. 

I‚Äôm in the middle of an It Takes Two playthrough with the wife and it‚Äôs a great time. Elden Ring blew my freaking mind, and it was fun being part of the online communities in that zeitgeist. It‚Äôs a good time to be a gamer, with whats come out recently and whats in the pipeline. 

But its also been a bit lame and lonesome. All my friends want a PS5 but they have given up over a year ago on going above and beyond to find one. And to be fair, its fucking ridiculous. And paying above MSRP is also a nonstarter for everyone I know. I am effectively the ONLY person I know IRL that has a PS5. Everyone else has moved on to Xbox which is actually attainable or even quit console gaming for PC gaming or other hobbies entirely. Other friends arent excited to play lesser versions of new games on old hardware so they forego new titles to hopefully experience them when they can get a newer console. 

I don‚Äôt really care about what the caused the supply shortage, be it covid, scalpers, chips, poor planning. But its been a strange year. It‚Äôs both the best time and a very disconnected time to be a gamer for IRL gaming friendships and interactions Ive had for the past 3 decades. 

TL;DR Love my PS5 and the new gen, just wish I could share that excitement with friends and family who have been left behind. Cheers."

1,"The gaming industry needs to study Insomniac Games and start modeling the rest of the dev teams on them Not only does Insomniac have 2 next gen PS5 games currently in development, they are going back and delivering patches for both Ratchet and Clank and Spider-Man Rememstered/Miles Morales games on PS5 one day one of the VRR release on the console.

Adding innovative new techniques to getting the most performance out of their games, with Fidelity modes in both those games now running at 50fps with VRR and 120hz instead of 30fps when they first came out. And with Performance Ray Tracing mode on Ratchet and Clank now running at an average to 90-100fps even though it's arguably the best looking console game to date.

These people are doing magic and I don't see any other AAA studio right now running at their level, like clockwork consistently pushing the envelope and delivering great games while leading the way in ongoing support of older releases, with zero scandals and complaints from employees."

I know this might sound ridiculous for most people, but for me it makes perfect sense as I don't like replaying games at all and for multiplayer ones I could make an exception and buy them SH if they're PS exclusives (I already got a PC for most competitive gaming).

Any help or pointers are greatly appreciated.

Thanks"

1,"LG Oled C1= game changer!! I'm pretty sure it's prolly been mentioned before and I know there's an LG oled C2 out as well, but let me just say that I came from playing the ps5 on the following tvs such as a 4k tcl(49in), lg Oled c7(65in), LG Nano cell 90 series(75in), Vizio oled(55in), and lastly an lg Oled C1(48in) and while the vizio oled tv and lg nano cell 90 were really good tvs, what I didn't like about the nano cell was the blooming issues the tv had and the blacks were good just not as good as oled. And vizio was good but there's alot of software issues But the lg oled c1, man oh man the colors are just spot on and the level of details the tv brings out compared to the rest is a massive improvement. I didn't really think it could be that much of a difference in color or detail switching from the vizio oled to the lg c1 but boy was I wrong. You can tell the difference in quality immediately and all the latest gaming features seem to work on this tv for me at least. But I just wanted to say if anyone is looking for a gaming tv just save up and get you an lg oled. The prices for them these days have been to bad. This is the only tv so far where I barley had to change any of the tv settings, everything out of the box is pretty much picture perfect at least to my eyes."

1,"So should I just give up and go back to Xbox? Hey there, I'm new to the PS community. Really I'm not a part of it, but I was hoping to be. I have never owned a Playstation except the original console way back when. I became a fan of Xbox when it first came out because of titles like Halo and KoToR, games that were exclusive to Xbox at the time and then just kinda stayed with Xbox over the years. However, these days, I find myself playing a lot more titles that have online multiplayer elements where community size matters. And I had no idea that the PS community was 3 times the size of the Xbox. Especially with FromSoftWare titles, two of which, Demon Souls and BloodBorne that I never even got to experience. And damn I wanna own Elden Ring for PS5 over Xbox Series X. What I'm saying is I made the decision I wanna change sides, but is it worth the trouble?

Thing is, I simply can't find a PS5 from a non scumbag source. And I've been told that the PS5 will most likely not become widely available, as in being able to walk into a Best Buy without fear of being sold out, until mid 2023. I was actually told that back in February of 2021 by two different people, which I laughed off at the time, obviously I no longer think its funny. Now I just recently purchased a decent gaming PC, which was a bit pricey. I could maybe afford to buy an Xbox Series X (they are easily available to me), to hold me over awhile longer until the PS5 is more available, but what I cannot do, is afford to then rebuy all the games I purchased for the Xbox, again on the PS5, know what I'm saying? With prices on everything going up like crazy I'm trying to be very careful right now.

So I know I'm kinda talking to myself here and maybe this was a pointless post but I was wondering if anyone was in a similar boat in this logic; is it really worth waiting for the PS5 if it's going to take another year to get here? Like at that time, the system will be going on 3 years dated, when I could buy a Series X tonight, keeping all my microsoft purchase library for all the many titles I have already bought that I never played, which are in the dozens, and just say screw PS, or do you, the members of the PlayStation community think it's truly worth the wait? 

Guys I'm sorry if this comes off as a stupid question that I have already answered myself, that was not worth taking the time to read, I'm just having a hard time right now personally, every little thing is getting to me. I feel obsessed over which console to get, and video games right now are the only thing that takes my mind off of some really heavy shit I'm going through. Is it worth waiting or should I just stay with Xbox and wait for the PS6 instead? Thank you all."

1,"Something I noticed about PS studios games This might not make a lot of sense, but from what I've seen playing spiderman, god of war, horizon, death stranding is that the games tend to pile on mechanics at the very beginning of the game. Right at the beginning all of your options for combat, movement, customization are all available in their entirety, instead of other games which start slow and add mechanics as you go. This makes the games feel confusing and off balance at first but after a few hours, woah mama"

1,"Internet connection I have been using my PlayStation 5 since Nov 20.  About a year ago I started having connection issues. I play a ton of rocket league. I would get a couple min into my session and I would start to ping badly. The game would be very hard to play and made me not want to play at all. So we upgraded our internet to gig. And bought a mesh system for the house. Excited about this I started playing again and nothing got better. I would be about 2-10 min in and I would start to have ping upload download issues. I started restarting all my nodes and router. I would repeat this process multiple times and nothing would worked. (Frustration) (don‚Äôt want to play) 
All devices on network are fine but my PlayStation is having issues. So I started to restart my PlayStation. If I restart..load a game I will get 2-10min and have issues. On the third or fourth restart I will finally be able to play. Now I‚Äôm already in 30 min and have checked out of the process. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on here. It‚Äôs definitely a PlayStation problem. What do I do? Can anybody help? I have tried WiFi and cable hook. Nothing fixes it except multiple restarts. Thank you."

They should not have done such big news on this feature that reaches few people. It will be a revolution when they'll support FreeSynch, everything else is linked to proprietary technologies, and it's a shame to the numeric world.

So I love how the PS5 turns on the TV and Receiver when I turn on the PS button on the dual sense controller.

I was really interested in Remote Play from my iPad Pro.  I installed Remote Play, bought an extra dual sense that is only linked to the iPad.

When I link the ipad Pro to the PS5 with remote play, the PS5 goes from rest to on mode.  I understand that this is normal.  What I don't like is that the HDMI link activates the TV and receiver.

Is there a way to have HDMI link turn the TV and Receiver only when using normal play? (So that using Remote Play does not turn on the TV and Receiver?)

Thank you"

I have been trying to buy a PS5 since launch.. It was so difficult that I gave up for a while, but after hearing success stories, I registered to buy one. Last month I got an invite and managed to make it all the way to the checkout page. I thought this was it.. But to my surprise, no matter what I did, it wouldn't let me checkout (not a stock issue, but rather a payment issue..read more in my previous post)

I contacted SONY, they looked into it and a few days later they sent me an exclusive invite to buy a PS5 on Wednesday between 3-8PM. I made sure everything was in order and even asked 2 good friends to stand by with their credit cards as backup. I got to the checkout again and received the same error. I thought no worries, I have friends helping me. So I asked friend #1 to use his credit card. We tried it 2 times and both times it placed a hold on his funds but no checkout. I then called friend #2. We did same thing, again payment error. I stopped and figured we tried too many times. 3 days later I tried again with another card to buy another item from the store and again payment was declined. I contacted SONY, they looked into it and again invited me to buy a PS5 on Wednesday. But no matter what I do. No matter who I contact. No one seems to be able to fix this issue. I have read that more people have similar issues and I think its just unfair to loyal customers. A company this big should have phone support or at least offer more payment options like paypal for instance. By the bare minimum they should have someone explaining what is going on."

The issue is when I load it up for a free trial my previous account is still linked and won‚Äôt let me log in with new credentials (not even giving me the option for enter a new username). 

The only way I can do a free trial is to use a different user on the PS, not ideal. Do you know if there is any way to unlink my main PSN to that old Square Enix account. I have obviously tried contacting them to no avail."

1,"Upgrading your existing PS4 library to PS5 is a nightmare, and I really wish I was warned about it beforehand. So I finally got my PS5 today along with a 2TB M.2 drive, and I couldn't be less satisfied with my purchase. And it all comes down to the absolute nightmare that is upgrading your PS4 games to PS5 versions, as well as continuing your saves on the performance enhanced PS5 versions of these games I was previously playing on PS4. 

Here are all the different variations I've ran into so far when it came to trying to boot my old PS4 saves on the PS5 versions of applications. 

1. (Paying more than the base cost of the PS5 game. Eg.: FFVIIR) - The upgrade to the base game is free, but you have to buy the content that comes with the PS5 version separately. And it's twenty dollars, which means you pay $80 for a $70 game if you bought it on PS4 originally

2. (Have to download both PS4 and PS5 app. Eg.:FFXIV, FFVIIR, Spider-Man) - You have to download both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game to your PS5 to transfer your save/settings over. Even though I transferred the save data over directly from my PS4 to my PS5 using the Data Transfer feature, I still have to manually boot the PS4 version of the above games to convert the PS4 save data into PS5 data. For certain games, PS4 save data can only be converted to PS5 save data WITHIN the PS4 version of the app. Meaning you have to download the same 80GB~ game twice just to be able to continue the save on the PS5. 

3. (Trophy Progress does not transfer even though your save does. Eg.: Elden Ring and GT7) - Game save will automatically convert which is great, but trophy progress between the PS4 and PS5 version isn't synced. If I play the PS4 version of Elden Ring on PS5, my trophies carry over. But if I continue my PS4 save on PS5, none of my trophies carry over. Which means I won't be able to get a platinum unless I kill all those bosses I got trophies for in a new game or New Game+. Haven't yet looked to see if any trophies I previously received in GT7 are now locked out due to my Dave's progress)

4. (Spider-Man. Just... Spider-Man) - This one is NUTS. And I haven't completely figured it out yet. But I can't upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from in the PS4 version of the app. And there's no purchasable upgrade within the PlayStation store. Apparently you need to buy Mile Morales Ultimate Edition to get the upgrade. And then you upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from the MILES MORALES APPLICATION. Wut???

5. Cyberpunk 2077 - Haven't finished downloading the app yet, but apparently you literally need to do nothing. Just download the PS5 version and your PS4 save is there. Trophy list carries over too from what I've seen. Completely baffled as to why this game with one of the shoddiest launches ever seems to have their version upgrade process down pat. 

So every game seems to work differently, and there's no guidance on any of it at all. You just boot a game and find out if you're lucky. And if you're not, it's to Google you go to see how/if you can bring you PS4 saves/trophies to the PS5 version of the game.

This to me is beyond unacceptable. I've been hearing about Xbox's smart delivery and how you just boot the game you want up and you saves are there and everything is optimized as needed and the buyers remorse I currently have is huge. I bought a PS5 for FFXVI/FFVIIR and because I had this massive digital library on my PlayStation 4 I wanted to hold onto, and right now I feel like I've been‚Äìdue to those two things‚Äìforced onto a platform I really want nothing to do with. 

Anyway, I know this is very ranty for an r/games post. But I think these examples are very important for potential buyers to be aware of, and I know if I saw a post like this, I would have held off on upgrading to the PS5. So hoping this stays up for others to see."

I've looked up what to do and all I've really seen is to cancel my card and get a new one, so that the card on file for the PS4 is invalid. Is there any other way???"

1,"I don't regret buying a digital PS5 I purchased a digital version for my girlfriend, and recently I obtained a digital version for myself. The digital version is much sleeker, lighter, and it looks so much nicer standing up than the fat, bulky original one. It feels at least 2lbs lighter, and is much easier to move around and take apart when inserting an SSD, just due to how much thinner and lighter it is.

&amp;#x200B;

And aesthetically speaking, it just looks so nice a trimmed down compared to the disc version - with the fat protrusion jetting out from its side. This post is my own personal experience to counter the popular ""I regret buying a digital PS5"" thread on the homepage right now. Aside from not being able to purchase physical discs (if that's important to you), every other aspect to the digital PS5 is a positive compared to the bulky disc version."

Or is there any chance it will change in the future? The VRR for Xbox series x/s for example does not require HDMI 2.1. It works also with HDMI 2.0, so why does Xbox supports it and PS5 doesn't?

1,"I regret buying a digital PS5 I got my digital PS5 in February 2021. Why did I go digital? Because I noticed that I would buy nearly all of my games on the PSN store when they were on deep discount. I'm patient with games, I can wait.

However, lately I've been having the itch to play newer games. I wanted to wait till Horizon: FW got a price drop but was anxious to play it and thought ""do I want to wait 6 months to save ‚Ç¨20"" and just bought it for ‚Ç¨80 (here in Germany). Then I looked and found that you can buy it on disc for as little ‚Ç¨35.

I think the digital PS5 would be fine for people who don't need the newest titles, or just have a shit load of money to burn. But having the games on disc means I can get newer titles much cheaper and can sell them afterwards if you don't plan on replaying them anytime soon. Hell, even if you want to replay something a few years later they'll be super cheap.

Does anyone else have regrets? Has anyone else sold their digital PS5 to buy the disc one?"

1,"DualSense no in-game input after firmware and OS update I updated my controller firmware tonight to the latest version and the controller works in the dashboard but not in a game. The only way I was able to make it work in-game was to:

1.	‚Å†Switch communication mode from Bluetooth to USB.
2.	‚Å†Go back to the game.
3.	‚Å†Turn the controller off by unplugging the cord.
4.	‚Å†Plugging the cord back in to turn the controller on WHILE IN THE GAME. This was the key part - the controller had to come on while in-game (no dashboard menus) for it to register game inputs.

It‚Äôs bizarre. Is this a reported issue or am I just super special like my mommy told me I was? I‚Äôve never had an issue with the controller otherwise and have owned the console for awhile now."

I know Sony used cheap ports on the PS4 but was surprised the same problem is still here. I even called a repair shop to get an estimate on how much it would be but they told me the part isn't even available to buy from China.

1,"PS5 is having disc drive problems I have a day 1 PS5 with disc drive that has been well taken care of. One day for no reason when I ejected my game the disc itself comes all the way out, instead of mostly out so you can take the disc. I have to literally press eject and then hold my hands under the disc slot to catch the disc as it comes all the way out and falls into my hands.
Then the system continues to try and eject nothing at this point while making very loud ejection sounds. It does this cycle 4 times and then it's done. At this point I can not insert another disc. If I try it does nothing.
I learned if I press eject,  catch the disc, then lightly tap on the side of my PS5 disc drive ( maybe 5 to 10 light taps) it will stop its ejection thing its doing right away. Instead of its cycle of 4. As I am tapping on its side I listen for a light click sound. When I hear that it will allow me to insert another disc and play like normal.
This is a process I have to repeat everytime I want to play a different game.
Any help or ideas?
I have not taken the system apart yet. Hoping it's a simple fix if I do.
Sony was supposed to send me a box to it in for repairs at 14 months ( thank you to Reddit for saying Sony was still accepting warranty repairs after a year) but it didn't show up and when I got in touch again Sony wanted money.

1,"Is there a reason why almost no developer uses the touchpad for gestures? Anyone who has used the touchpad of the dualsense/dualshock 4 for text input can attest how intuitive and easy it is.

My ideal use case is emotes in games like *Elden Ring* and *Dark Souls III*! Just a quick swipe with your thumb or index finger over the touchpad and voila, wave emote triggers. It doesn't even need a button press.

Is it too complex to implement?

Does it require too much cpu which is needed elsewhere?

Or maybe there **is** a button press or touchpad press needed to register in the system?"

1,"Turn off Activity Cards I've found a Frankenstein approach to turn off the Activity Cards. If you do the following, it should remove the cards and stop them from appearing as far as I can tell:

Under Settings:
- Notifications &gt; Games That Notify You &gt; manually unfollow each game
- Captures and Broadcasts &gt; Auto-Captures &gt; Trophies/Challenges &gt; select none or turn off Auto-Capture feature for both trophies and challenges

On the cards itself:
- Pro Tip Card &gt; Select 'Options' and select dismiss
- Any existing Trophy/Challenge cards &gt; select to open all captures and delete them

Now, this approach will mean no new videos of trophies or challenges are collected and your old ones are deleted, but you won't see any cards - so if your goal is no activity cards at all, this should do it. I called PS to confirm this would be a good approach and they actually took down MY notes to help other players in the future.

Cheers!"

1,"Likelihood of Freesync support being added? It's my current understanding that only 13 monitors on the market currently support PS5 VRR. This is absolutely ridiculous: the cheapest monitors on the list all cost more than the PS5 itself. Why should I spend 600+ on a new monitor when my $200 monitor is completely capable of Freesync and the PS5 has an AMD chipset?

I'm legitimately considering getting the cheapest m32u as soon as i can afford it, but when that's more expensive than  a new XSX (which does support Freesync), why would I get a marginal upgrade to my display when I just get a more fully featured console that uses my current display better?


All that being said, it seems not only anticonsumer, but actually kinda stupid of Sony to not enable Freesync. I was not seriously considering an XSX before this half-baked VRR update, but now Sony has given MS a great advertisement. Of the more advanced users that care about VRR, how many of them are gonna shell out 600+ for the new display instead of just a new console for less? And this is all assuming that these monitors don't start getting scalped. There is very little selection and supply of these PS5 vrr compatible monitors, and since almost anything related to the PS5 gets scalped at some point, I would not be surprised to see cheaper units like the M28U, M32U, and the XB283K start selling out.

All of this being said, I think there is at least a chance that Sony eventually adds Freesync support. It doesn't seem likely (one would hope they would have realized how few monitors are supported and just included Freesync in the latest update, if not earlier in the consoles life cycle), but considering how this just suggests to customers to get an Xbox instead of a new display, I would hope that Sony reconsiders. What do yall think?"

1,"Dualsense touchpad issues I can't seem to find any clear info on this issue, especially on how to resolve it, so if anyone has seen another post about this please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to give a detailed explanation of the problem:

Whenever I've used the touchpad button input a few times the motion controls and touch input seem to malfunction. 

**General ps5 interface;** When typing something the cursor gets stuck when in the motion control mode of the keyboard. 

**Game examples;** In Ghostwire Tokyo you can used swiping on the touchpad to switch between 'weapons' and in other instances in the game you need to paint a symbol by swiping on the touchpad, but after having used the button of the touchpad this starts to act erratically. 

Another good example is GTA online, you have to hold the touchpad button to open the frequently used quick menu, but this messes with the weapon wheel or radio wheel to the point where even the stick input doesn't work to switch weapons or radio stations. It also messes with the ingame webbrowser used to access a multitude of services, the cursor keeps popping back into the upper left corner when you try to move it with the touchpad or stick.

&amp;#x200B;

**Temporary fix;** When I restart the controller it seems to fix the problem until I start pressing the touchpad button again. I've also tried compleatly resetting the controler but it just gives the same result.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to exchange my controller once before because a spring broke in one of the triggers, but both controllers have had this same issue. I've only recently started playing games that make more use of the touchpad and it's really quite annoying, especially in GTA Online (just tried to get back into that game and there are other reasons that reminded me why I quit in the first place, but having to turn my controller off and on again so often does not help either).

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows how to fix this more permanently or if it's just a bad controler and I need to go back to the store, please let me know."

I really appreciate this system. Sure, it‚Äôs not the holy grail for gaming, but what it does offer for PlayStation consoles, this model has hit all the right notes."

1,VRR is already live  
1,"120hz/VRR is absolute game changer for fidelity modes and should be implemented industry wide. No more compromising frame rates when choosing quality. Playing Miles Morales this morning with 120hz/VRR on and it runs at a smooth 50fps with zero screen tearing or any visible frame drops for me it's indistinguishable from 60fps, all achieved with no resolution or quality hit at all. 

I know these features are still on the higher end side but in a few years they'll be standard in TVs just like 4k became."

I moved recently but it lined up with the newest update to the controller by a tiny bit. Basically, when I'm playing a game the controller has strange inputs and drifts and in some cases will also randomly disconnect. I ended up buying a new controller because I thought mine might be broken but the new controller is having the same issues with connecting. Strangely it will also seem to have a fine connection and no drift or strange issues but then a second later will have the problems. I'm not sure what to do as I haven't found much for this issue through Google or anything. Any help or tips would be appreciated."

So I went to check my ps5 and surely enough I did not see that option and yes my system was connected to the internet om rest mode and I did restart my system also as I read some comments had said to do so and the VRR option still did not show up. So what I did was go to settings, I then clicked on ""system"", afterwards I clicked on ""system software"" and scrolled down and clicked on ""System Feauture Updates"" and it said ""please wait"" and I was then greeted with a message saying ""the latest version of all system features are installed"", so I went back to check under the screen and video options tab and now I was able to see the New VRR option tab, so hope this helps if anyone turns on their system and doesn't see the new VRR option right away."

1,"120hz + VRR in Insomniacs games is amazing. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a PS5 and a 120hz + VRR capable TV.

This morning I downloaded the patch for Miles Morales that enables 120hz mode and VRR, and I have to say it‚Äôs excellent.

When properly enabled it sets the games quality mode to 40fps, and then with VRR it allows the game to go above 40fps when able without any issues.

Imo it‚Äôs a game changer (pun intended)."

1,"Is it just me, or are the side plates extremely tight and hard to put back into place? When I first tried to take off the top-facing side plate on my PS5, it was extremely difficult. I used the correct method, which is to pull the corner with the PS Logo up and slide down, while bracing the bottom of the console, however it still took a considerable amount of force, and the hooks on the plate left some superficial scratches on the black part of the console when it finally came off. Furthermore, I cannot fully attach the plate back onto the PS5, as the two circular hooks to the left and right of the PS logo will not go into place for whatever reason, no matter how hard I try to align the plate or how much force I apply while pushing it."
1,"Rest Mode Charging Issues Hi!
I recently bought a brand new Ps5 (finally!!).
It's amazing, but there is a problem.
When I try to put the console in rest mode and try to connect the dual Sense or the headset (Platinum wireless headset from Sony) on the front USB port to charge them, they don't actually charge. 
I checked the system options and verified that the USB port alimentation on rest mode is on (is set to ""Always"") but nothing changed.
The system has the most recent update and the charge when the console is powered on (not in rest mode) gives no problems.
It's a common problem of the ps5 or I bought a faulty one? 
Thanks for the answers."

This is a game changer for fidelity modes going forward, especially in first party Sony games. Those with capable displays can now enjoy the highest fidelity settings without compromising frame rates."
1,"Has anyone used the Steel Series Arctis 7p+? I recently bought these from Walmart and I have to say I am severely disappointed. There are no highs, no lows, and the mic picked up my friend through our voice chat and he could hear himself through my mic, even after turning down the sensitivity all the way in the PS5 settings. Between that and the awful soundstage of this headset, I can't see why anyone would recommend or even buy these.
Did I jst get a bunk model? I tried them on my phone and PS5 and both have this very narrow band of just mids, everything else sounds muffled."
1,VRR works with HDMI switches and TCL 50S546 TCL 50S546 $429 on sale VRR Supported I also tried it on the Xbox Series X works perfect as well.
1,"Sony dropped the ball with this VRR release. Only goes down to 48hz, when Series X goes down to 30hz. This needs to be worked out. This means games like Elden Ring won't benefit as much on PS5 as they would on Series X as frame rates below 48 will not benefit from VRR. 

I don't understand why they would hype this feature so much and nerf it. I suspect it's due to the fact Sony TVs don't support VRR lower than the 48hz range. 

This is a terrible reason to release a feature and nerf it compared to your competition."
1,"Speakers for PS5 Hi all,  noob question. what are the recommendations for speakers for PS5?

Currently i'm running e25hd through soundblaster G6 (usb). Music and movie wise it's ok. But when it comes to gaming, the sounds are quite muddied/drone-y around the low to mid range. i'm not sure whether it's my speaker issue or my ears (i find the e25hd exceptionally warm thus used the g6 to tune the response)... the current game i'm engrossed in is GT7....."
1,"Why cap the PS5 VRR range at 48hz+? Is it because Sony TVs have that range. This makes no sense for most supported displays The most popular LG OLEDs support 40hz+ range, why cap the PS5 at 48hz+? This means fidelity modes in most games won't even be boosted with VRR as much as they could be if this artificial cap wasn't placed on the VRR support. 

This is disappointing after the long wait seeing as the main feature I was excited about it being able to play in quality mode setting with higher frame rates without compromising on fidelity."
1,"Game recommendation that you finished I have downloaded and played tons of games and the only games I actually loved and finished are Red Dead 2, the last of Us 2, uncharted, life is strange, and it takes two. Would love to see more good game recommendations, thx!"
1,"VRR is live now - Running Elden Ring in VRR Okay, probably most of you have already seen video from Vincent (HDTVTest) on YouTube in VRR alreay being enabled in PS5. I checked whether VRR is available in settings or not and to my surprise it was there without any update. Ford up couple of games to check if this was indeed working on my LG CX and it is definitely working. I know HDMI 2.1 is not super common, but it's a start and maybe Sony would roll it out for 2.0 as well in near future.

I'm really excited to try out Elden Ring on my PS5 now."
1,"Please explain VRR to me, in really dumbed down terms. So I'm not big on tech. I've heard decent things about this VRR thing. I haven't tried it on my Series X, but might with my PS5. What exactly does it do?

I'm here thinking it's gonna make framerates better. I have a 120hz Sony tv that can do VRR. So will it make the game seem as if it's running that high? I'd like to know what it can do."
1,So does VRR/120hz mark the beginning of the end of 30fps on consoles? It seems like 30fps is becoming a thing of the past. Even in quality mode it seems these games can now push 40-50fps with the help of 120hz/VRR.
1,"So can someone explain the VRR/120hz magic to me? I'm meeting frame rates of 100-110FPS on high fidelity games like Spider Man and Ratchet and Clank when without VRR thee systems would probably need to run these games at 720p to achieve those kinds of FPS results. 

How is VRR increasing performance by this much and is it that the TV itself is handling the brunt of the performance?"
1,"Havent received VRR yet (Im in Asia), or is my HDMI not compatible? My HDMI is a Vention ‚ÄòHdmi 2.1‚Äô (or so they said) which I bought because of the longer length than sony‚Äôs. This hdmi has ‚Äòultra high speed‚Äô label on the body.

It sounds like a sprig or coil is being strained to be pushed down. Is this normal or is there something wrong with my controller?
1,"PSA Regarding VRR and Fidelity Modes Unfortunately, It appears that the PS5 is limited to a 48-120hz VRR range even if your TV or monitor supports 20-120hz. This means that VRR is limited to frame rates of 48fps and higher. Fidelity Modes that cap frames at 30 or 40 frames per second will not benefit from VRR as it will not be engaged despite your TV telling you that it‚Äôs enabled.  

This can be shown by paying attention to the refresh rate on whatever info dialog your TV shows. When VRR is working between 48hz-120hz you will see the refresh rate fluctuating. When VRR disengages it will cap itself to the fresh rate of the panel (my C1 shows 119 when playing 30fps modes for example) and provide no benefit despite stating that it‚Äôs enabled. Reason being is the TV does technically recognize it as being enabled but if it falls out of it‚Äôs allowed range it disengages and waits for the frame rate to fall back in range so it can re-engage VRR.  

Not sure if it‚Äôs a hardware limitation or something that can be patched through firmware, but if you want to take advantage of VRR you‚Äôll need to be playing on the various performance modes that allow for 60+ frames. On the bright side uncapped performance modes are feeling great and people seem to be reported that games like Elden Rings performance mode feels much smoother."

Haven't gotten a straight answer on the Google for this question. 

All I want to do is stream PS5 play on Twitch while having my PS5 hooked up to one of my computer monitors. Do I need the adapter or is that just if I was playing PSVR? Or do I actually have to buy the PS5 camera?

It is not my TV because it works fine with everything else. Any ideas?"

I love single player story oriented games, like spider-man, god of war, and the horizon series. stuff i can really get lost in, if that makes sense. I hate stuff that is stupid difficult like souls games.

any suggestions? I want to take advantage of this, and get to play stuff i don't have access to through steam. thanks!"
1,"Ride 4 for PS5 with the season pass is on sale on PSN. It‚Äôs an AMAZING racing game, and the best playing and best looking motorcycle racing game I‚Äôve ever played. Make sure that you get the PS5 version. The PS4 and PS5 versions are totally different games and there is no free upgrade. 

If you wanna know if it‚Äôs worth it to get the season pass, I think so. It cuts the grind down to zero by letting you get double credits and gives a bunch of bikes to get you started. If you prefer the grind you can buy the season pass afterwards for slightly more money if you chase your mind. 

This is my favorite game on PS5 right now. It has the best use of the dual sense controller of any PS5 game. Yes, I know what I‚Äôm saying, it‚Äôs better than Astro. You can feel the rear wheel about to slide out from under you as you accelerate through turns. You can feel the wheels coming very close to locking up as you brake. It provides such amazing feedback I believe that gamers on other platforms would be at a huge disadvantage if there was cross play."
1,"PSA for enabling VRR on your LG OLED TVs 1) Ensure you‚Äôve connected the factory HDMI (2.1) or any other supporting 2.1 HDMI to your TV

2) Turn on Instant Game Response, Deep Colour Output and Freesync in your Picture Settings

3) Go to PS5 settings -&gt; Screen -&gt; VRR and toggle it off and turn back to Automatic

4) Enable the unsupported games toggle as well

5) Launch a game and once it has booted, press the green button on your TV remote a couple of times (press repeatedly) until a popup appears on your screen

6) In the Popup if it says ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù then your VRR is not on, if it says VRR and shows you the live fps, then VRR is working for you!

Try out the above steps and let me know in case you face any hiccups, cheers!"

Im in a hotel, that has wifi without any safety (no Password and NO BROWSER LOGIN) at all, at the moment.
I can connect to it, download games and play GTA Online (example).

In UFC 4 for example, it shows me, that there is a problem with my PSN-connection. When i check it at settings it has no connection issues at all‚Ä¶

My PS+ subscription was also up for renewal in the coming days and so I bought a 12 month pre-paid card. I was unable to redeem this. I tried to extend my subscription in the PS store on my PS5 and I keep getting an error message.

So I rang Sony Support, they told my that my prepaid card still has a use on it so it's not an issue with the retailer, but were also unable to redeem it for me. I also mentioned about the PS store not allowing me to extend my membership and receiving an error.

They looked into it and said that multiple extensions are disabled at the moment. Clearly this is in preparation for the new PS+ switch.

But it's crazy that I could be without PS+ in a few days because of this, and who knows if I'll even be able to redeem my pre-paid cards."

I can see games I own in my trophy list that are at 0% but I've at least booted them up, but SURELY there's a way to see a games trophy list without having to actually free up SSD space, install it, and then run the game?

Seems like a lot of hassle.

Originally, I didn't even know how to turn on the 120 hz mode, so I was stuck at 60 hz. I finally worked around that and now the games play much better. Today, I read about VRR coming to PS5 and honestly, I am super excited. It remains to be seen how this particular feature will perform though. Hopefully, in the future, games will have a wider range of settings you can mess with like being able to turn off shadows which bother me a lot when playing FPS games. Good job Sony !"

What makes the changing frame rate of a VRR enabled game look good whereas with a non-VRR game it looks pretty bad?

On the PS5 the games are really few and far between but I know there has to be some hidden gems

L.A. Noire is the obvious choice but is pretty dated and at this point the facial animations just crack me up. I remember being obsessed with this game when it first came out and really wish Rockstar would dive into this genre again  


Disco Elysium is the one I've played most recently and damn is it good. I NEED more narrative games like this where your choices truly shape the story. One of those games where I wish I could wipe my memory and play again

Detroit: Become Human for certain sections is such an atmospheric detective game. Playing those sections as Connor at crime scenes was so good and makes me want Quantic Dream to develop a fully fledged detective game.   


Witcher 3's monster contracts honestly made you feel like Batman a bit - while there wasn't much choice in solving the mystery, following the clues and then consulting the bestiary once you had enough evidence to formulate your plan of attack was some fantastic detective gameplay.  


What other games am I missing? What is worth trying to scratch this itch? Thinking about possibly The Wolf Among Us before they release the new one. Is Sherlock Holmes Chapter 1 any good? The gameplay trailers I saw for it kind of turned me off. I recently tried Lost Judgement but the style was a bit too cheesy for me"

1,"Data not transferring to USB flash drive + software errors For a few days now, I haven't been able to transfer data correctly from my Media Gallery to a flash drive, and it looks like the console's USB ports may have something to do with it. Seeing that there have been lots of posts around here detailing issues with the USB ports, I was wondering if anyone had this same specific issue:  


\- When trying to transfer screenshots from the Media Gallery to an external flash drive, the transfer process gets stuck at 0% indefinitely, and I'm forced to cancel eventually.  
\- Bizarrely, even after canceling at 0%, a portion of the screenshots do get saved to the drive. Although it's always the same batch from the same game. The console acts as if I only screenshots from that particular game existed.

\- Even MORE bizarrely, the console still copies those same screenshots from that same particular game to the flash drive even after I DELETED them from the Media Gallery, while remaining stuck at 0% and forcing me to cancel the copying process as usual.

\- I normally use the front USB-C port, but the problem happens with all of them. In fact, the console doesn't even recognize the front USB-A port when I connect drives to it.

\- I've been in touch with customer support about this and they had me reinstall the latest software update, restore licenses, reset console options to default settings, delete cache and rebuild database. Nothing worked.

\- Each time I try to transfer data from the Media Gallery and this happens, the console also takes an unusual long time to power off. It stays well over ten minutes on the ""Preparing to turn off your PS5..."" screen. Next time I power it on, an error screen pops up requesting a report to Sony.  


I have nearly 500 screenshots saved in the console and there's no way to get them out of there like this. I could try to factory reset the console, but that would wipe them out. And based on everything I tried, I'm not even sure that'd solve anything either. Support insisted that it's probably a minor issue, and they said I could always wait for the next OS update, but even that I'm skeptical off considering reinstalling the last one didn't do anything. It feels like a more serious problem overall."

It lists the Old Hunters DLC, but it just says ""usable"" next to it with no option to install it. It seemed to work when transferring Mortal Kombat 11 content, though I have the same issue for that game too with a 2 or 3 of the add ons.

1,"My PS5 suddenly stopped detecting ANY of my controllers. Hi guys! I need help, like really.

Since the PS5 update from March 23rd, none of my 4 Dualsense controllers are detected by my console. 

I tried to connect them with USB, by Bluetooth, Resetting with the small button. (basically everything i saw on Youtube) Most of the tutorial i saw online are not related to my problem.

In fact, my Dualsense is actually recognized by my console, and sometimes i'm able to navigate for about 3 minutes before it shuts down and then starts charging. After that, it doesn't work anymore. I read online that maybe it was some kind of problem related to other Bluetooth devices in the environment, so i installed my PS5 in my bedroom instead of my gaming room and it doesn't change anything.

After that, i decided to completely reset my console with Safe Mode. Funny enough, when connecting my controllers by USB in Safe-Mode, it actually works perfectly (which is strange)

Nothing changed at all. 

Now i can't even get past the initial setup of the console since the controllers are disconnected after 3min.

One of the last thing that i remember doing before the update was connecting my Dualshock 4 to my PS5 to see if it works. It looks like it's related to the problem since i can't even connect my DS4 anymore. 

It's so strange because my PS5 was working perfectly. And my controllers are detected by my PC too so basically it's just my PS5 that doesn't to cooperate.

Anyone can help me? Thanks !"

1,"Not happy with my PS5 (soon 1 year experience with it now) Charge controller 2-3 days, playing with it on USB cable, use wire-less for like a day tops. The PS5 controllers is the most shitty thing i've ever had so far. Not to mention how a brand new controller just died after just a first months. I still have PS4 controllers that are today over 5 years old, never any issues.

For many reasons i feel that the PS5 in general is a flop to me. Be it the terrible, overcomplicated, stupid UI, the controllers, the lack of the next-gen feeling (playing HZD 2 on Ultra HD top TV and can't see much of a difference), the haptic that to me is rather annoying than cool, as feels half a\*\*ed. Also individual background pictures look so bad, laughable resolution. As for changing it i start my PS4 for it, to then use on PS5, as the PS5 for whatever reason makes it look shitty. Advertisements and 2 task bars...-\_- No option to create folders. A simple thing like leave a chat turned into a bothersome task.

I was never ever a Xbox fan. To me no way. But still, can't say that i'm much pleased with the PS5 so far. That never happened on any PS i had before, as i did really enjoy all of them and always felt improvement on upgrading.

With this one here i hardly do get used to. But that might be just my opinion."

I just bought the PS5 and tried to join it to my wireless network.

My WiFi network is compromised of an Extreme Networks AP305C supporting WiFi6.

All devices work on this AP depending on their capabilities either natively to WiFi6 on both 2.4G and 5G. Other downgrade to 802.11G, 802.11N or 802.11AC depending on their radio.

&amp;#x200B;

The PS5 works without any issues when I explicitly configure my AP on the 802.11AC protocol.

The DHCP server works and internet connectivity is OK.

When I try to offer 802.11AX on the AP all devices work except the PS5 where for some reason it does not accept the DHCP offer from the DHCP server.

&amp;#x200B;

The AP has been moved to direct line of sigh and a few meters away from the PS5 in order to check the power.

When it first connects it states approximately 90% power.

&amp;#x200B;

Static IP address assignment does not work either which makes me think that their is a bug on the WiFi6 protocol support.

1,"I'm really tired of having to deal with the ps5's bullshit!       The ps5 is one of the most finicky devices I've ever owned. I'm so frustrated at it constantly, I feel like almost every other time I turn it on or boot up a game it throws an error at me. Most of the time it's a simple fix but it's so annoying. But the cherry on the sundae of shit just happened to me, I just had to factory reset my console (with no other options) just to get it to boot up. I don't pay for ps+ because I mostly only play single player games, but apparently it only cloud saves your data if you have it. 

      I've had my Xbox series X for about 6 more months than my ps5 and it is just works so much better. The thing that caused the need for a factory reset was a power outage during an update. They always say don't turn it off which I've tried to stick to but it happend anyway the  funny thing about that is same thing happened to my xbox series x and my xbox one x (maybe I should get my power checked out) but neither of them needed a factory reset it just started the download over. Also if it did factory reset on Xbox consoles you don't need xbox live to use cloud saves. 

    If it wasn't for exclusives (and maybe the dualsense) my ps5 would be in the garbage. Also having a ""software issue"" that deletes saves and locking cloud saves behind a pay wall is pretty damn shady."

1,"I implore every PS player to not allow adverts in our games! I know everyone is probably sick of these boycott type call to arms that never end up coming to fruition but I beg each and every one of you to never, ever buy a game that has adverts in it. 

A full price game should be priced as such so that a developer/publisher can make the profits they think fair for their effort but to charge 70 quid AND have micro transactions AND have adverts is inexcusable. We have allowed publishers to get away with including MTX in full priced games (don't get me started, you know who you are) but we can't lose this fight. I understand if a game is F2P, in that case have at it, but if you pay the launch price for a game then they have no right to include MTX and advertising, I honestly would rather pay 80 quid for a game if that's what it takes to ensure the future of a good dev but I cannot stomach adverts in games, I just can't. I wouldn't accept it in a DVD and we shouldn't accept it in games!

1,"Is this UI ""common"" in the PlayStation console? Hi everyone

**Disclaimer**: This is the FIRST PS console I have ever owned!

I am not sure if this is expected from a PlayStation but I am slightly (negatively) surprised about the UI for the PS5. On a smaller scale, I expected the game icons to be bigger and detached from the PS Store and other icons.

But, on a larger scale, I expected the ""Close Game"" icon or the ""Turn Off PS5"" button to be visible without me clicking other buttons to get there.

Maybe it's just that I am not used to it and it's always been like this... Just wanted to know the opinions of those who are used to the PlayStation consoles."

So now I have a supposedly ""shipped"" digital ps5 only to then see the idiots at BOA declined the charge despite having approved the original charge for it. lol.

The tracking just says label created so obviously they won't ship and I'm sure walmart isn't competent enough to let me update payment and will cancel it all because ABOA and Walmart are both full of idiots.

Then walmart support just says if it's canceled order it again. yeah because that is so easy to order a digital ps5. lol.

What's funny is BOA constantly does this at almost every store, decline decline decline, yet when there really WAS fraud they didn't catch it and put thousands of bogus charges on my card."

Hi guys, I am happy to announce that I finally managed to snatch a PS5 after online and in-store stalking for almost a month and I am currently looking to creating a list of what games I should play. I do have PS+ and snatched the free games for April and all the PS Collection Games (I just finished GoW and I am currently playing Bloodborne) but I am quite unsure of what games to buy and play next since this is my first PS console and I come from a heavy PC gaming background. I grew a bit too old for online and heavy grindy and repetitive mmorpgs (yeah, I'm talking about World of Warcraft) so even though I do not have a preference for any genre, I do like games with complex stories and mechanics (huge FromSoftware fan, played DS1/DS2/DS3/Sekiro and currently messing around in Elden Ring). So, what should I play next?

&amp;#x200B;

My current list looks kinds like this:

* Demons Soul
* Heavy Rain
* Beyond Two Souls
* Until Dawn
* ASTRO's PLAYROOM
* TLOU 1 &amp; 2
* Detroit Become Human
* inFAMOUS Second Son
* Watch Dogs Legion
* AC: Valhalla
* Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves
* Persona 5

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;nbsp;

I have two charging stations and I got so frustrated with it that as an experiment I added little rubber risers to the top of one (little strips of rubber along side the two spots where the controllers cradle, stuck between the white and black plastic of the charging station.) End result: They act as gripping feet for the controller bottom and you can drop the controller down willy-nilly and it just lands right on the charging spot every time.

1,"PS Direct Not Fulfilling Replacements TLDR: I sent my PS5 for exchange with PlayStation Direct after being told they had available replacements, but they‚Äôre now refusing to send the replacement due to a ‚Äútechnical issue‚Äù with their systems since March.

Be careful about doing exchanges with PS Direct. My WiFi would crash whenever connecting to a 5GHz WiFi network. After troubleshooting with PlayStation Support, I was offered warranty service but was told that I could end up with a refurbished unit. Keeping in mind that PS Support is separate from PS Direct where I bought my console, I figured it would be safer to go back to PS Direct and exchange for a new unit since it was within 30 days if they had any available.

I contacted PS Direct chat support, and my case was escalated for someone to call me about an exchange. We discussed at length that they had replacement inventory available, and I would receive my replacement within 10 business days, and so I agreed.

According to FedEx, PS Direct received my console on March 16. I had read about others receiving their replacements from PS Direct within just a few days, so I grew worried when the order status website hadn‚Äôt updated a week later. I spoke with PS Direct chat on March 23, but all they could say was to assure me that it would be sent out within 10 business days (with 5 more to go), that they saw my case was escalated, and that someone would reach out to me further.

No updates or contact a week later, so I reach out to PS Direct chat support on March 29. I am now told that the exchange policy is for 12 days instead of 10, and their website was updated to reflect that. They at least confirm receipt of my console according to their warehouse. I ask if the old 10 policy still applied to my replacement, and they agree to have a supervisor get back to me. (It seems the 12 days policy was temporary, as the website was updated again the next day back to 10 days.)
I follow up with PS Direct chat support again on March 31 and April 1, but nobody had any additional information. Later that day on April 1, I finally get a call from a PS Direct supervisor. I am told there is some problem with their system; they did receive my console; but it‚Äôs ‚Äústuck‚Äù in their system which prevents my replacement going out. I am offered a refund and told that I can try to purchase a new console in the next drop.

It's now April 21. I end up receiving only a partial refund and I still don‚Äôt have a PS5 console, and I'm stuck with a bunch of worthless games."

1,"Steelseries Arctis 7p+ not the quality i was expecting.. What‚Äôs wrong? After a lot of reading and watching reviews I decided to upgrade my headset to the Steelseries Arctis 7p+ (200‚Ç¨). But despite being much more expensive then the one I had, Plantronics Rig 400hs (50‚Ç¨), the Rig‚Äôs sound is just better. Been using the 7p+ for a week now and idk, seems like the sound profile is not what it should be. A lot of reviewers claim it‚Äôs one of the best for PS5?!! I‚Äôve been adjusting the EQ a tad here and there but no good result.

Are there more people having the same thought‚Äôs? I‚Äôm gonna give it a couple more day‚Äôs and if no better going to change it. But to what.. maybe just gonna go for the Pulse 3D.

Fellow 7p+ users, what are your thoughts? Is this recognizable?"

This is the one that has the 4 paddles, rubberized grips, and still retains all the original adaptive trigger functionality and haptics.

Here's a review from PC Magazine. Biggest knock against it seems to be price. [https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/scuf-reflex-pro](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/scuf-reflex-pro)

I'd love to sell this to someone locally (Orlando FL) to avoid shipping, but if you want to pay for shipping, I'll sell it to anyone. PayPal ONLY, or cash works too if we meet up locally. Not sure what to charge for shipping, but I paid $12.99 so probably something like that, or more if you want it expedited. 

Price is $229.99, same as what Scuf sells it for. 

NO NEGOTIATING. I'm not stuck with this, I can return it and they are waiving the restocking fee. I just thought it'd be cool to give someone the chance to grab one if they missed the pre-orders."

He claims the console has been out for almost 2 years and you still have to fight for one or get ripped off by a scalper.  He claims the average lifetime of a console is 6-8 years.  Does that mean you've already lost 30-35% of the PS5 useful life???

1,"Sony should capitalize on native backwards compatibility. The PS5 is becoming boring.   

* The Playstation 2 was backwards compatible with the Playstation 1 OG. Initially, the Playstation 3 was backwards compatible with the PS2 and PS1.
* The Playstation 3 Slim and Super Slim were backwards compatible with the PS1.
* The PS4 had no backwards compatibility with previous consoles and struggled to emulate PS2 hardware such as games like the PS2-Classic: The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy. 
* The PS5 has backwards compatibility with the PS4, owing to the fact that the PS5 was built on the PS4 architecture, making them essentially the same. Needless to say, when I play a PS2-Classic title such as Bully on my PS5, it constantly freezes and stutters, much alike the PS4 version. 

Although each console's graphical developments are always next generation, their hardware capabilities post-PS3 era are going backwards at the same time as they are going forwards. After a few months of owning my PS5, I came to this conclusion. Whenever I felt the need to play games from previous generations, excluding the PS4, I had to tediously plug in either my PS3, PS2 or PS1. This, in turn, reduces the amount of time I can spend playing on my PS5. Since purchasing my Xbox Series X, I no longer need to plug in my previous generation Xbox consoles, unless I want to play something that is not on the backwards compatibility list, such as Two Worlds. I no longer have to worry about plugging and unplugging hardware, fumbling through AV cables/separate HDMIs, and finally deciding which game belongs to which generation in order to play. 

It would not be a waste of money to spend millions of dollars deciphering their own PS3 architectural language in order to get the games running natively on a PS5. What a waste of energy and money is Sony running hundreds, if not thousands of PS3s in a basement around the clock to be streamed by paying customers via PS Now, and eventually PS Plus Spartacus, despite the streaming service being nearly unusable for the majority of players due to technical issues/input lag/etc. Sony needs to up their game, and I say this as a die-hard Sony fan who has to resort to a 3rd-party such as Xbox in order to accomplish such things. I'm also willing to bet that no PS4 owner with no prior console experience has ever played Grand Theft Auto IV or Midnight Club LA. One might ask, ""What's the point of buying a new console if you're just going to play old games?"" The answer is to have more options for playing games; out with the old and in with the new applies to almost everything other than gaming. 

TL;DR All of this in a nutshell: sometimes, people, such as myself, get burnt out playing new games, and want to play titles of the past feasibly."

There is probably a bias there towards PS Plus members for Sony selecting you for a PS5 restock.  In the restock email, it said that you had to click the link at 2:00.  If you clicked the link before 2:00, it said that you would be blocked from the link.  I watched the clock and as soon as it turned to 2:00, I clicked the link only to find out that there was an hour long wait.  Are they allowing people in early?

We were quite excited to get the chance to actually buy the console. But he was busy with work today so he asked me to do a favor. He gave me his CC info in advance.

I used two different PCs to login his queue and my queue. His queue(12min) was shorter than mine (20min) so I was able to order one for him successfully (that feeling was soooo good!), but when I tried to order mine PlayStation kept telling me the item is limited 1 per household. It is two PSNs, two shipping addresses, two names, two credit cards and two billing addresses.  I guess IP address cannot be same either? Anyway the stock was gone, so I only managed to score one for my friend.

1,"Playstation Direct Process is Rediculous Recently got the lottery invite to the Playstation Direct website to buy a console. After clicking on the link right at opening (did it right at :00:00) and then waiting in a 15-minute queue, they sold out within a minute of me entering my information. I understand that in these processes the receipt of an email, getting to the front of the queue, or apparently even having it in your cart is no guarantee to a console but this is getting ridiculous. The Playstation Direct stock drops should work in a way that, since they are already limiting it to one console per household, there are exactly as many units available as emails they send out. That way, the lottery system is effectively a reservation of a console. I understand that not every person who gets the email will participate in the drop so they open it up to more people than they have supply for but honestly underselling in each drop wouldn't be the worst thing. It would allow them to role supply over to the next drop, allowing for more frequent drops. It would also build more goodwill with the customer, which Sony is lacking on given the shitty release this console has had over the last two-three years. At the moment, and I have seen others on here who feel the same way, they have a customer who was excited to be given a chance only for the rug to be pulled out from underneath them when their hope was at its highest. Obviously, I am grateful to have had the opportunity but I am bordering on just giving up until the next iteration of this generation. The world is back open (at least from a Western/Northern perspective), there is no longer an argument for the inability to have units in the store like every other console release ever, similarly limited to one console per government ID or whatever other form of limiting. Sony, as I am sure I am the millionth and one person to say it, fix your fucking shit."

1,"Dualsense repair (UK) Anyone had any luck using the Sony repair portal? I'm trying to enter my serial number to request a repair for some bad drift I'm experiencing (which is frankly an appalling consumer experience on a console less than 6 months old), but I keep encountering an error when entering. Anyone else experienced this? Also, how are folks experiences with the repair system? Is it worth bypassing altogether and just accepting the need for a new controller?

As an aside, the dualsense drift issue really is ridiculous. I experienced it on the much less robust Switch controllers after maybe a year. To experience it on something as otherwise well made as the PS5 after less than half that time is laughable. The fact that they push ¬£60 atm and are in kinda short supply just kinda adds to the frustration."

I‚Äôve tried dampening and holding the ps5 very tight but it‚Äôs definitely louder than it should be. It sounds a lot like a phone vibrating on a floor for too long does anyone have any advice?

1,"Does PS5 lag after system software update is downloaded and installed? I have this frustrating experience where my PS4 will most likely lag after the said update is installed, not the game update, but the system software update. 

I have tried reinstalling the database, disconnect the internet connection or make sure the connection is ok, reinstalling the game but every time only safe mode option 6 or 7 can solve it, which means games have to be reinstalled, With the latest update 9.51, the lag happens again, and this make it the third time already. *\*sigh\* \*eye rolling\**  


I do not think my HDD is failing for the following reason.  


1. Currently own a PS4 Slim 1TB, bought it brand new in 2020.
2. Usage: solely gaming. For most of the period (2022 until now) since I have bought it, I seldom have time to play on it. If I do play, the usage time on average is 1-3 days per week, each time 2-3 hours. 
3. Storage usage: never used up more than 50% of maximum capacity.
4. PS4 is handled with care, never drop it, cleaned the dust so no overheating, turn off properly when not in use.

So I want to ask fellow PS4/PS5 owner, do you have this issue?"

1,"Can get PS5 to turn on normally, but cannot turn it on to Safe Mode This is a really strange one, and has been an ongoing problem.

&amp;#x200B;

My ps5 has the problem that it will every now and again not turn on properly and will need to be started into safe mode to clear the the cache until will not just boot to a black screen. This will last for a bit, and after about 5 or 6 months I haven't had to do it at all. Until two nights ago I had to do it twice in the week. Now today, after getting an error message for my ps5 over heating, I was going to rebuild the database from safe mode, but now for the life of me cannot get it to start in safe mode. It will make the second beep, change the light color from blue to white indicating that it is indeed in safe mode, but just like how my normal launch would be to a black screen, this is now only showing that black screen for safe mode. Even stranger, is that I am infact able to launch it normally all the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried power cycling twice now, tried different outlets, but cannot get it to launch back to safe mode. Anyone have any suggestions I haven't tried yet? Will be contacting Playstation support soon."

2. I've heard some rumblings about saves not transferring from PS4 to PS5, is that still an issue (if it ever even was)?
3. Do Games that have a PS5 upgrade need to be re-downloaded in their entirety or do they just need a patch downloaded?

And finally, the big boy...

My controllers will not connect to my PS5 at all and the PS5 has been basically bricked since I can‚Äôt play any games. I‚Äôve recently found out that if I disconnect from the internet by restoring my default settings via safe mode, my controllers work completely fine. However, since I am not connected to the internet, I can‚Äôt play online or download any digital games. I expected this to be fixed by this latest update but I haven‚Äôt heard a statement from Sony acknowledging this problem even if not many people are experiencing this. I‚Äôve been having my PS5 since day one and I‚Äôve never had a problem with it until last months update."

1,"PS5 success story. In idk about other states but in Utah there's a store called RcWilley. And they sell electronics. Today i decided to look on their site to see if they had stock but their site said ""out of stock"". On their site the PS5 digital version is listed for $469. I was confused about this as we all know the digital version is $399. So i decided to email the store and see why the price was higher than retail and if they would price match the retail price of the item since it was listed somewhere on their site. Within minutes i received a response. 
The agent explained that the price is that way because it's actually bundled with a controller. Hence the $69 dollar price hike. 
I said ok cool, now that makes sense. I proceeded to ask if they were getting any new stock soon and they responded that they usually get stock every 2-3 months. He added that he could add me to a wait-list if I wanted to. I gave him my information to be added to the wait-list and he responded that they actually had a digital version in stock if I wanted to purchase it. 
I was shocked! I was not expecting them to have stock since I was just looking for info. 
I told him yes I want the PS5 (obviously) and he then sent me an email confirming that the PS5 was on hold for me. I left work and headed straight to the warehouse and I got my PS5! 

I'm so glad I didn't give in to any scalpers and that my patience stayed with me along the way. 

For anyone still in search of a reasonably priced  PS5 don't give up. I know this shortage is annoying but don't give in, you got this."
1,"‚ÄùRelaxing‚Äù game Hi guys and girls, 

So how should I put this. When I game I play a lot of games where you need to be focused, like really focused. For example F1, it‚Äôs a very unforgettable game, like NHL with the whole Ultimate team mode where you need to play to get packs and hopefully good players and so on.. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is that many of the games I play today is sometimes mentally draining and I need something that can be relaxing in some way. Like I want a game where you can come in, do something for an hour or tow, it won‚Äôt impact anything, it doesn‚Äôt push you to do any missions or anything like that to beat a boss. 

Do you have any tips?"

1,PS5 copying Updates after Software Update? So I own my PS5 for about 2 years now and I never had to copy an Update file before. On the PS4 that was a huge problem for me. Now I installed a recommended Software/System Update and my PS5 starts copying game updates now. Why?

1,"Buying a digital version of a physical game Probably a simple answer, but wanted to confirm before: 

Currently playing ""The Last Of Us II"" on the PS5, using the disc / physical version. All our other games are digital, except SackBoy which our little girl plays. The way the PS5 is set up, swapping the discs between games is a bit tedious.

We scored some PSN card from a contest a while back, and see that Last of Us II is currently on sale. 

If we buy the 'digital' version on the Playstation Store to avoid needing the disc, do we basically just uninstall the current one and then download + re-install using the digital one for it to no longer ask to insert the disc?

Assuming save states are, well, saved lol..."
1,"Dualsense pressing random buttons/not taking inputs? I have two Dualsense controllers, one that came with the console and another of the colored line that i‚Äôve only been using for a few weeks. Neither have ever been dropped, damaged, etc. Since i updated the controllers to the newest update, i‚Äôve been having almost constant issues with them. It‚Äôs not quite stick drift, and it affects every button. If i press a button, it‚Äôll act like i‚Äôm holding it down for about 5 seconds or so, and occasionally the buttons just straight up don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried powercycling the controllers, the console, resetting the controllers, and unpairing them. Unpairing and resetting seems to fix the issue for about ten to twenty minutes, but then it comes back the same as before.

1,"Overheard some resellers talking‚Ä¶ Was at a thrift store and there were a couple resellers that beat me to the video games, they just had them all stacked in front of them and were scanning through them with Amazon app. Ugh I hate seeing this but it what it is. They were talking loudly though and bragging about how many PlayStation 5 consoles they had. One claimed to have 5 consoles and the other had 4. 

I already have a PlayStation 5, so I am not worried, but still frustrating to hear this. They were talking about they were hold long term until the prices are at peak. 

My opinion on this is that prices have since peaked, and I for one would refuse to buy from a reseller out of principle. Hearing them brag like this just makes me hope they get stuck with the consoles lol. Yea maybe a bit immature on my part, but I just want customers that actually want the console to have them, not resellers. What do you guys think?"
1,"Playstation Account wrongfully suspended So basically, I redownloaded LBP3 on my playstation because I was really bored. I went and tried to find worlds that would offer free items from the story since I didn't really wanna complete it. I found some but there was one specific world that was so messed up. It was basically a troll and wasn't giving anything. It was literally costumes of sackboys in KKK costumes that were surrounding what I can assume a black person on an upside down cross on fire. Now what I would assume a right minded person would do was to report it, which I did. I literally went to the good grief option then selected report and wrote that this was literally a KKK rally and I didn't expect that I needed to explain that much as the screenshot that was required to be posted was self explanatory.

Later after 5 minutes to my surprise I see a notification that I breached playstations code of conduct. I check my phone and I get an email that I am banned from using playstation services for 7 days due to hateful content.

I tried contacting playstation live chat and they said they cannot help me and I'd just have to wait out the days I'm suspended for. I tried calling live support and they wouldn't help at all and whoever I spoke to they would say the same thing ""that the safety moderation team takes investigations very seriously and their decision is final"" and they have it in their system that I got reported for hate speech even though it was technically ME who reported a game level and got myself banned. Is it cause in the report description I said ""it's literally a KKK rally?"" with a screenshot attached??? You cannot tell me a human being went and saw my report and made that decision. It had to be a bot and they do not want to admit that because no sane person would go through and suspend me for what happened.

And now I'm going to be stuck being paranoid not knowing what will happen if I get suspended again for doing nothing and not knowing how severe they can make it. There is nothing I can do about it nor anyone I can talk to that can actually help me. I guess whenever I see anything that's fucked up I'll leave it be because in the end I'm going to get punished."

1,"definitely give Cyberpunk 2077 a try on PS5 This game is definitely playable with the current patch (1.52), I really enjoyed it unfortunately I can't share any screenshot in here but CD Projekt put a lot details in the game world in the story and characters. The story has deep roots, the characters are unique the game play is flexible it can be done  both stealthy or all out combat, the gun play is awesome so as melee or using Katana they all feel unique and special. The visual and details are stunning on PS5. I can describe every aspect of the game but that be spoiling so much of it. Self discovery is definitely worth it for something like this. but the world of Cyberpunk is definitely worth discovering the lore and culture its very interesting. I personally enjoyed playing this game I have over 167 hours of game play, and during this time I have encountered few visual bugs but nothing that prevented me from playing the the game, I had very few game crashes in patch (1.5) but since patch 1.52 that happens very rarely. If this post ends up encouraging you to play this game definitely share what you think of it afterwards."

1,"Sackboy is a better Mario 3D World There. I said it, I know I‚Äôm gonna piss off someone for saying that but in my opinion, Sackboy takes inspiration from Mario 3D Worlds but actually improves it and does its own things enough to make it stand and here is why:

- Levels in 3D World are fun but really forgettable, short, and most not having unique visuals. I barely remember a few if I have to be honest with you. 
Sackboy on the other hand, I think I remember almost every single level I have played. They are all very memorable, beautiful art direction, right amount of length, and still fun to go through. Especially music style levels. 

- Co-op in my opinion feels a lot more thought-out in Sackboy than Mario 3D World. For starters, it still has chaotic elements but encourages team work through gameplay a lot more, especially at few levels that require another person. Also, we didn‚Äôt had to wait until the switch for online co-op in Mario 3D World. Sackboy had that shit at launch.

- Lastly, side stuff in Sackboy feel actually rewarding and get challenging but still keeping the core fun platforming and reward you with post game world. What does 3D World do? Having to require to 100% the game each as the four playable characters and having to do through slow ass captain toad stages that made me fall asleep. Yeah, thats why I never bothered to 100% 3D World.

If you like 3D World more, I respect your opinion but please. Stop calling Sackboy a ripoff of that game."

It is my first gaming system ever (I'm in my late 30s), and I haven't found a game that I jive with that lets me relax, unwind, and just have fun. Ultimately, I'm looking to sell my system for what I bought it for, but don't know if that is possible (have the supply issues been resolved?)

The system is the version with a disc drive and it has about 100 hrs of playtime on it. Would it be possible to get my $650 back for the system, 2 controllers, and charger (I will only sell it as a set)? Are there any scams I need to be wary about? How do I erase my data from the machine? I plan on putting a CL ad to sell it, so I guess someone would need to come into my house unless someone else has an idea of how to sell it while avoiding that. I'm hoping to sell it to someone in their 30s/40s looking to escape life."

I downloaded the app to my tablet only to find the dual sense control(which works fine in android itself) doesn't work in the PS remote app. I chose the easy route to get around this and used my PS4 dual shock, but it appears to have a bad battery or something, keeps dying, so I was back to finding a way to get the dualsense to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually saw an article that said they fixed the issue in May 2021, but that doesn't seem to be the case for every device. The dual sense works fine with PS remote on my pixel 3, but not trying to play on that small of a screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are some other apps aside from Sonys official one so I bought PSPlay and tried it, the dual sense still doesn't work wirelessly on the s7 plus, but does work wired, which i can tolerate but is not preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I am missing as to why it works wireless on one device but not another with the same version of android(well Samsung has OneUI, but I meant both Android 12). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stick to playing wired on PSPlay, or is there another app I could try?"

1,Will Sony make a separate PS VR2 livestream or will it be a part of the PlayStation Showcase? My take is it would be better if they include it into the PlayStation Showcase. Most people are watching this livestream because they know it's the main event for Sony. So this way a larger audience sees the potential of PS VR2 and maybe they can get them interested in VR if they didn't bother about that technology before. A dedicated livestream would probably mostly attract people who are already interested in VR in general which could hurt the success of the device.

1,"Remove rumble &amp; adaptive trigger motors I've got a spare ps5 controller that I've modded with the extremerate buttons on the back. However, it's quite a bit heavy now and am wondering if the controller will still work if I completely remove the rumble and adaptive trigger motors? I am using this controller solely for fps games, and ways have the vibrations disabled anyway."
1,"After trying Performance Modes I can‚Äôt go back to prioritizing graphics I always aimed for the closest to 4K experience limiting myself to 30fps gameplay. Recently made a switch to Performance Modes in Horizon: Forbidden West and Ghostwire Tokyo and oh boy, I can‚Äôt go back to the sluggish mess of ~30fps. 60 frames is a bliss, games feel great and super responsive. I‚Äôm more than willing to sacrifice some resolution and effects for that feeling of smoothness.

Oh, I wish for a PS5 Pro in the future where we‚Äôll have the best of both worlds."

1,"What are your PS5 Pet Peeves? I absolutely adore the PS5 but I've gotta admit...there are a couple of things I wished were better. It took AGES for me to get used to the PS button compared to how it worked on the PS4 so I wish that just worked in a similar way but I'd say ny biggest gripe would be how party chat works with the controller. Lemme explain...

When you enter a party chat you can use the PS5's built in mic. Not the greatest mic in the world but it does the job, wonderful. However, the party chat audio comes out of controller as well and it is QUIET! You can barely hear ehat your friends are saying no matter how loud you crank all settings up and you'll most likely need to turn your TV down to hear anything. However, there's no option to get the party chat audio to come through the TV screen while you're using your controller's mic as an option, which forces me to use headphones. I've had to grow accustomed to using the headphones but before I was very pleased with using the PS4 camera as my mic in party chats and just have the TV as the speakers. No need for headphones, it was a glorious age...

One last pet peeve would be the HD Camera. I kinda get why it doesn't have a built in mic but yo...gimme a mic dammit ü§£"
1,"HDR makes screen flicker I had a 1080p monitor and decided to get a budget 4K TV (ACER 4K BL SERIES) to play the PS5 on. Everything worked great, until I turned on the HDR. It had no issues when I turned it on while I'm logged in on the console, but restarting my TV or PS either makes the screen flicker (in black) or I get a ""No Signal"" error.

I've tried 3 different HDMI cables, including a 2.1. As per a few suggestions found around the internet, I've tried switching off the HDCP, tried -1 &amp; -2 transfer rate, turned off Overscan on my TV Picture setting, but to no avail.

Confused if it's a hardware problem or something to do with an option in the TV or the PS. Everything runs smooth with the HDR turned off, or if I turn it on after the PS is turned on without it. I've played 7-8 hrs of game with HDR on but the moment I restart either of the devices it goes back to this flickering freak show."

1,"Sony really needs to do something about PS+ redemptions blocking PS5 upgrades So I picked up a physical PS4 copy of Overcooked: All You Can Eat recently due to it having a free PS5 upgrade which I decided to grab today, despite already having the PS5 version redeemed through PlayStation Plus. To my dismay, I learned that if you've redeemed the PS5 version of the game through PS+, it acts as though you already own the game and won't give you the option to redeem your free upgrade. Some might ask ""Well who cares? You already have the game through PS+ then so just install that"". Well, yes, but let me make a couple of points on why that isn't ideal:

First and foremost, we don't ""own"" PlayStation Plus titles. These are temporary licenses that expire once your PlayStation Plus expires. If I've purchased a PS4 game that is meant to give me access to a full, permanent license to a PS5 game, I'd like to be able to redeem that whether I have the PS+ license or not. Instead, I'm stuck with the temporary license.

Second, when you put a PS4 disc into your system, it checks to see if there's a PS5 upgrade available. If there is, the disc won't install immediately. This gives you the ability to choose which version you'd like to install first and is great for saving space. I say this because when the PS5 first released, if you placed a PS4 title into the system that had a PS4 upgrade, it would install the PS4 game regardless and basically take up double the space. This was later patched to give you the option before anything installed. If you've redeemed the PS5 version through PS+ however, it skips this check, and immediately starts installing the PS4 version off the disc as soon as it's placed in the system - exactly how it worked before it was patched.

I have looked online to see if there's a way around this issue. Someone suggested deleting all versions of the game, then hiding the PS+ version from your library. Apparently this would allow you to grab the PS5 upgrade from the store, but it seems this method no longer works. Some people have also tried contacting PlayStation Support to get their PS+ license removed, which they've been told can't be done.

Now, to be fair, I have no idea if when my PS+ runs out everything will revert back to how it should be and I'll be able to grab my free upgrade. But I really shouldn't have to wait that long for a feature that's advertised on the box."

1,"anyone kno why my PS5 controller isnt working? ok here's the story...

 i'm on pc, not console. until recently i havent held a console controller in my hands since sega dreamcast was the newest thing out. anyways, i recently wanted to buy a game i have to have a controller for so i ordered a PS5 controller from amazon. while waiting for it to arrive my roommate let me borrow his old PS4 controller.  he installed something on my pc for it to recognize it as a PS controller instead of Xbox. the PS4 controller worked fine.  the PS5 controller arrived and it worked fine too but then i stopped using it right away bc i didnt feel like configuring all my buttons again and got bored of that game anyways so i put the controller away for a week... then i decided to get back on that game and the controller wouldnt work... the border around the touchpad would flash blue for a second then turn off... i restarted my pc and it worked fine again. then i stopped playing that game again for good and put the controller away again for like 6 weeks.

so i bought another game that needs a controller and the controller wasnt working again... i figured it was sitting in a box for 6 weeks maybe it just needed to be charged so i left it plugged in all night but it still wouldnt turn on, it would just have the flashing blue lights around the touchpad then turn off... then i remembered how before restarting my pc fixed it so i restarted my pc and it worked just fine again but then the very next time i unplugged it it wont turn on again no matter wat i do but my roommate's PS4 controller still works fine.

any ideas?"
1,"What 2-3 specific recent gaming experiences have made you felt EXCEPTIONALLY HAPPY to be a PS5 owner?  For me, it's been

1) Playing Elden Ring PS4 version and experiencing that game at a perfect 60 fps which PCs can't even do atm üòÇüòÇüòÇü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ it literally never deviates from 60 fps (I'm level 300 slowly playing through the game cuz that's how I do it, max out my favorite stats in the first 3rd of action RPGs üòÜüòÜüòÜ)

2) Playing the PS5 next gen patch for GTA V Online and experiencing almost perfectly consistent 60 fps using the ""performance with ray-tracing"" graphics mode while experiencing very immersive haptic feedback on the Dualsense. Gunplay feels real with trigger resistance that actually does it's job. Driving is a joy and feels and looks great 1st person on a motorcycle feels NICE. 

And music vibrates the controller so you feel like you're ACTUALLY in a club, car, etc. It's pretty next level and shockingly well done! They really invested in Dualsense optimization (LOOKING AT YOU ELDEN RINGüòíüòíüòíüòí).

3) Fortnite on PS5 is ridiculously smooth and fast loading and this season has no building and added sprinting so it's just fast gun play and running around, I am a poor man but playing this game on PS5 makes me feel like I am rich if that makes sense üòâüëçüôè just wanted to share, thanks!"

1,"I just beat Ghostwire: Tokyo yesterday after 30ish hours. Here‚Äôs my honest review I had my eye on this game ever since it was announced. The aesthetics immediately grabbed my attention, and the game director at the time of the Bethesda E3 was both charming and passionate. The game quickly joined my other list of potential buys, and I kept it on my radar over the months

Some troubling developments made me concerned: the director left, the game seemed to shift from horror to action, etc. but the biggest thing working against it was it‚Äôs release window. Coming out so soon after some gargantuan releases like Horizon Forbidden West and Elden Ring meant there was very little chance it was a day one purchase anymore. My game of choice was Elden Ring, and after 300 hours across 3 playthrough and a platinum later,  I found myself in that dreaded, nebulous mindstate most of us fall into

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù

I tried playing through Kirby, Control, and Alan Wake. I felt like I was on the right track, but something still wasn‚Äôt clicking. Then I took a crack at Ghostwire, and here we are again wondering what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôm pretty sure the gameplay gave me the shooter itch so I‚Äôm going to replay Doom Eternal on PS5 this time so I can get into the DLC naturally since I beat the game before any had dropped. But before I do, I wanted to take some time to write out my thoughts on this probably hidden gem of 2022. I know, I know, it just came out a month ago. But something tells me this might not have done as well as Tango or its fans would want, so here‚Äôs hoping it does well on Xbox so a sequel can still happen

I think my biggest gripes with the game are the lackluster New Game+ and nitpicks with combat and traversal. Since there aren‚Äôt a whole lot of negatives, let‚Äôs get those out of the way

#NEGATIVES

New Game+ does not inspire one to complete the game for a casual fan. Because basically nothing important carries over, I did not feel incentivized to collect every lost spirit, hidden tanuki, or artifact for cats. Which is a shame because this is a game that would excel at power fantasy on subsequent playthroughs. So as much as I enjoyed my time the first go around, I had no qualms jumping ship once the main mission and side missions were complete. I didn‚Äôt mind the mostly empty world since it fit the aesthetic and story, and there are enough enemies and activities to occupy you running, flying, and‚Ä¶crouching through Tokyo?

This is my next negative: the combat and traversal need some work. There‚Äôs just no getting around that, as much love as you‚Äôre going to see in a sec‚Ä¶there are some minor and major gripes here. First off, there is zero reason for there to be a crouch button if you‚Äôre not going to have a slide mechanic. You have vaulting, you have jumping, and yet I still feel like I‚Äôm playing a shooter from the early 2000s. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that since the combat was worked on by someone who worked on Doom 2016 and that game had heavy inspiration from its own history‚Ä¶but considering you have spirit powers and can glide, you‚Äôd think KK would let Akito dodge on the ground and in the air. So here‚Äôs my compromise: have parts of the game where crouching is needed use a context specific button prompt, or remove crouching sections entirely. Regardless of the decision here, the crouch button should now be a dodge. If you want to make it a slide when you‚Äôre running, fine‚Ä¶but the guard/parry are not enough defensive options, and crouch is frankly useless. As is melee combat and the bow

The least fun thing any game can do is take away the power fantasy. It‚Äôs not just a speed bump, it‚Äôs an absolute momentum killer. People who played Spider-Man know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about with MJ or Miles Morales missions. The parts of the game where KK is removed from Akito, even enemy attacks, SUCK. The bow feels horribly underpowered, undercooked, and like an afterthought. Unless you use prayer beads and (IMO) waste skill points on the bow‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just not fun at all. I didn‚Äôt sign up for discount Far Cry, I wanted to be Japanese Doctor Strange! For fuck‚Äôs sake, the biggest draw for me is the fact that it‚Äôs a First Person Shooter without traditional shooting mechanics! Which brings me to melee‚Ä¶why? Just why? You have this guy harnessing the power of the literal elements and his melee is a baby slap? Make him weave with melee! Supercharge his fists or something with rocks! Anything would be better, even a katana or SOMETHING to make it feel weighty when you have a chance to sneak a melee hit for SP regain

Okay‚Ä¶I think that‚Äôs the negative. I actually mostly have positives for the game

#POSITIVES

For starters, I think the story is serviceable. I grew to care about the leads, even if it falls under the trap of ‚Äúthe main missions seems really pressing, but I‚Äôm gonna not do that for dozens of hours‚Äù trope open world games fall into. While I did not care much for the villain, this could be fixed with him having a more taunting relationship with the leads through his ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù. I enjoyed the world and aesthetics, and if anything am grateful such an excellent modern depiction of Tokyo is now playable. The enemy variety is decent, but the AI could be more aggressive so long as my suggestions for combat and traversal are implemented to make it ‚Äúfair‚Äù

I love love love the talismans but think the button placement is wonky. I‚Äôm not crazy about putting it where the bow is on the touchpad (swipe left) or down on the d-pad, but it definitely can‚Äôt stay where it is as is. I also found that once I got used to using the touchpad for changing spells I NEVER used R1 to change spells again. So here‚Äôs my thought: since it is essentially a ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù, put it on R1 and make that the only radial menu if you hold it to change the type. Since Xbox won‚Äôt have a touchpad, make all spell swaps on the D-pad regardless of console. If the bow is removed per my negatives on it above, you could have a different element on the left

#CONCLUSION

I realize none of these changes can be implemented for the game in a patch or even DLC. These are more like my suggestions for a sequel. I think after some reflection, I would grade Ghostwire: Tokyo at a 7.5 / 10, maybe 8 / 10 on a good day. I think with some more time in the oven (and less of an identity crisis), the sequel could be 9 or 10 out of 10. Very fun game, and when the combat clicks and you‚Äôre in a groove switching between spells it‚Äôs addicting tbh

P.S.: Overhaul the sensitivity settings. Just start from scratch. Even with MAJOR tweaking, I was never in love with the camera. When I booted up Doom Eternal, it was perfect right out the gate. Granted, Id are the GOATS of FPS, but still"

1,"An Important Message For You Who‚Äôs PS5 Still Turns Off On Its Own - Why This Happens &amp; How To Truly Fix It. A brief recap on my personal experience with this issue. Skip paragraphs if you don‚Äôt want be bothered with my story.

My PS5 was turning itself off on its own while playing PS5 games (even PS4 update versions), several times a day. I cleaned it the best I could, following dozen of guides and advice everywhere I could find for this to no avail. I did ALL the TS steps from PlayStation support twice, I changed plugs, tried plugging it directly to the wall plug, you name it, but the issue persisted. I tried the vents for cooling and absolutely nothing was working. For months and months this was my reality.

One day, I was talking to a friend who I did not see for a long time. He fixes boat motors now and other sailing ship stuff and we ended up discussing motors and vents and from there I gave the PS4 and PS5 vents as an example for something I can‚Äôt recall. The discussion went to my current PS5 issue I had and he said to bring it in for him to check since I had nothing to lose.

I do it on the next day without expecting much. So I opened the PS5 for him and he said it looked very clean, and he saw the opening and overall venting system. He grabbed an air pressure gun, I mean a HUGE one used on boats, that shit was loud, and he adjusted the pressure. It was strong enough to push his hand slightly back when pressed against it.

I was very nervous but he started to explain that dust and cloth can diminish the full rotational potential of the fan and it could be why no matter how clean it was it would never stop telling the system to shut down. 
He went on and on about more technical stuff. I was afraid the potency of the air pressure would damage something inside but he told me it would be very unlikely so I trusted him.

So he started doing his thing and there was cloths of dust coming of from deep inside the PS5, nothing really surprising. Then he pointed the air pressure gun in an angle towards the vent and made it spin to max for around 10 secs. I was almost shitting my pants but again, I had nothing to lose.

He did that a couple more times and told me to let him know in a couple of days how it was. It‚Äôs been 1 month and a half and the PS5 has NEVER turned off again no matter how long it‚Äôs on or what I‚Äôm playing.

So yeah, I would definitely recommend going to a workshop to get this process done to the vent cause it worked flawlessly. Even the noise it‚Äôs lessen.

I think there‚Äôs hope for yours too. It‚Äôs not the end guys! Take it from me, who struggled every day trying to fix it in any way I could. In the end it took a boat expert XD 

Stay safe!"

Would a box powerful enough to essentially merge ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance‚Äù modes be enough to get you want to upgrade? Also considering they‚Äôll want to make a profit would you be willing to pay the premium it costs to do the upgrade, assuming a $100 price increase?"
1,"Am I likely to enjoy Tiny Tina's Wonderlands if I didn't enjoy Borderlands? To clarify, 90% of what I disliked about Borderlands was the terrain/theme. I found it very bleak (I know it's supposed to be, not shitting on it), but I've never been a fan of post apocalyptic. I also didn't enjoy the NPC's, but maybe that was because they were part of that world and I just wasn't vibing with them.


Anyway, I hear there's a lot of similarities between them, but without spoilering myself too hard from what I've seen of TTW it looks a lot more colorful and vibrant. In fact it looks pretty great from the photos on the store. But obviously it's not a cheap game, so any thoughts?"

1,"Skipped PS4, and want to play select titles on PS5 - better to buy discs or digital? Hey folks, just managed to snag a PS5 disc edition. I‚Äôve been waiting to get one to finally play some PS4 games I‚Äôve been sleeping on.

Is there somewhere I can get a rundown of the pros and cons of going disc vs digital on PS4 games for the PS5 today?

I know many of the basics (resale, price, PlayStation Plus, etc.), but I‚Äôm also interested to understand how games installation from disc works. Will it load as fast as going digital, will the disc spin up constantly (would prefer as little noise as possible), and things like that. 

Any other tips would be very much appreciated. Totally looking for fussy nuance here. 

Appreciate any replies!"

1,"this needs addressing I just got suspended for a week after some kid threatened to ban me after losing in a rainbow six match. I didn't send or say anything against the terms of service. He straight up mass reported my account and threatened to abuse the report system and he has. 

A fresh smurf account with like 10 games on it fucking mass reports my decade old account with 500+ games on it. I'm not understanding. I report people who send porn and gore to groups on psn and their accounts are still up and fine but I tell a kid to fuck off and leave me alone and I damn near get banned.

 I love sony but the report system is fucking broken and is used constantly against people by toxic ass children.
I pay my subscriptions, I buy games and I haven't had a single report levied against me for the 10 plus years I've been on psn and now in 2022 some stupid ass fortnite and siege playing kid can just get me suspended or worse? 

I've put thousands of dollars into my playstation account over the years and I specifically go out of my fucking way to avoid stuff like this. I literally do everything in my power to avoid toxicity and avoid getting banned and now kids can just fuck me and my account anyway.  Years of games, trophies, data and thousands of dollars can be gone just because some kid lies and reports my swear word. I'm tired of everything I do in games hinging on stupid ass salty ass children. 

I didn't tell this kid to go fuck himself or go kill himself. I told him ""fuck off and leave me alone"" and that's an offense to sony? I bust my ass at work every single day to be able to afford what I do on psn and some stupid ass kid who uses his mommy's credit card can just take all that away from me and others. 
 
So what do I do now everyone. Hope and pray this kid doesn't steal my account from me by getting me banned? Am I at the mercy of some fucking kid now?"
1,"Sound Lag Issues Whenever I use my new PS5 I get a delay in the sound after the image has been displayed (it's something like 0.3 seconds). This happens when it's put through the TV speakers, a soundbar and even when I plug headphones into the controller.

What's more it does it for *everything* on the PS5, including streaming apps such as Netflix and YouTube (making them unusable).

I've looked all over Reddit and the wider internet but been unable to find someone else with this specific problem (let alone a solution). If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any potential solutions, I would be very grateful.

I downloaded a few games and just let it sit there then when it asked to sync saved data it just died. Wouldn‚Äôt turn back on for a while. Then it would turn on with a blue light then right back off then it would beep but without a blue light. I tried power cycling, different cables for hdmi and power, different outlets. I even tried to do it on a new tv. I left the cables unplugged for hours and plugged in for hours to. Nothing seems to work it just turns blue or just beeps. I‚Äôve watched countless of videos but people seem to be able to get safe mode but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve held the button waiting for the second beep for more than 2 minutes and nothing each time.  Now I‚Äôm just lost I‚Äôve had a ps5 before and I gave that one away but now this brand new straight from Sony one has this huge issue. Any ideas or advice? Can I take a Sony direct PlayStation and have it replaced without having to wait so long for them to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it."

1,"Is forbidden west better than zero dawn? A little backstory i just got the ps5 2 days ago with a bundle with forbidden west. I have been an xbox gamer my whole life so i was excited to play forbidden west. I decided to get zero dawn before i play forbidden west and right now im about 10 hours into ZD. I cannot stress enough how disappointing this game is. The story and characters are so mediocre, the combat is also pretty boring. It feels like ive played this type of game a thousand times even though its my first play through i cant bring myself to finish this game but i want to play Forbidden west since it looks absolutely stunning, is it any better than ZD or more of the same formula. If its relatively the same as ZD than i think im just going to sell my copy and buy something else. Thank you (i know im in the minority with my opinion on ZD)"
1,"First Playstation since the PS2 I could only afford one console growing up and after having the PS2 swapped to Xbox 360 since it came out first (and was cheeper) stayed with Xbox for the next generation and now have a Series X. Towards the end of the PS4/Xb1 generation i realised i could now have both but decided to wait since the gen was nearly over. 

Now i have a PS5 coming my way and i'm wondering what i should try out first, God of War looks good  and Fall Guys looks like alot of fun, but it was The Last of Us 2 that made me consider getting the Playstation, Also wondering if there is some type of Gamepass to play all the PS exclusives or do i need to buy them"

I bought my PS5 back in december. Suddenly it just stopped working. I was going to turn it on and it just didn't turn on.

I personally believe that right now, Playstation 5 is tied, if not better than the Series X. (Opinion) I dont mean to start console wars, but if Playstation gets this right and this merge is somewhat close to gamepass, this will settle the console debate."
