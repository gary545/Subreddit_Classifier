From buying the game at launch to restarting and trying it out maybe 4/5 times since then till now I still haven’t been able to get into it, now with all this Ragnarok hype I was thinking of giving it another shot but man I’m not even sure with this game specifically, I generally love most games (got my first ever plat on Elden Ring!), Last of us 2 and RDR2 are prob some of my all time fav gaming experiences so it’s not like I don’t enjoy “linear” quality story pieces, god of war just has me thumped. 

I didn’t enjoy horizon either, I found Aloy to be very uninspiring of a protagonist and the story felt dull to me, just a couple of thoughts."

PS5,vnnc5v,Diablo II: Resurrected Patch 2.4.3 Live on PS5, 
PS5,vnmfzv,Wifi Adapter not initializing,"So, this has been bugging me for a while. I'm going to head this off by saying that I'm an IT guy with over 20 years of experience in various IT domains and networking is one of them.

I have an Asus RT-AX58u router that has both 2.4 and 5GHz enabled. Within the same home/apartment I also have a residential Wifi AP. Here's what's been happening with my PS5 ever since I've had it:

I turn on the PS5, and it will say I am offline. I check the network settings, and it won't show ANY SSIDs at all. Scanning for networks shows nothing. It should be showing:
 - My router's SSID
 - My apartment community's Resident Wifi
 - My apartment community's Guest Wifi
 - Next-door neighboor's Wifi broadcasting capable devices (printers, routers, extenders, etc)

And these following steps will work intermittently, or not at all to get the WNIC to connect to the appropriate SSID:
 - Restart PS5
 - Put the PS5 in Rest Mode
 - Shut the PS5 down
 - Completely power cycling by unplugging the PS5 from power and pressing the power button to clear any charge from the PS5

It is getting rather frustrating to come home, turn on the PS5 from rest mode, to find that it lost connection to the network. I'd perform the above 4 steps, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, trying to get it to recognize ANY available SSIDs at all.

Is there a known issue with the PS5's NIC's to not initialize properly??? I have a hard time finding any resources online that discuss this... so I feel like I'm about to have to get Sony to service this thing. But, before I do, I wanted to see with the community if anyone else has had this issue."

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have some clue when this game will go on sale? I've been playing a library copy recently and really like it, which surprised me. But multiplayer kinda sucks as I rarely find people to summon and as unlikely I get summoned. Apparently this is a player base issue? If so, you'd expect a sale to increase that player base. On the other hand, it's been so popular that they may just continue to milk it for full price. I'd like to buy but I've waited so long for a deal I feel I'm already dug in and need to wait lol."

It started happening when I was playing Warzone and then after resetting the controller and console a couple of times it was still not working properly even in the ps5 Home Screen and menus. Oddly, I started playing FFX-HD and it was working fine the whole time but then when I go back into COD is stops working again. For some reason I have a strange feeling that COD itself is causing this because Warzone has done strange things to my ps4 and ps5 in the past and actually thing has made my DualShock 4 buttons stop working at times.

Have a friend shoot water at the enemies while you use shock for a devastating effect.

Combine protection and fire together to make fire enemies give you tremendous health whenever they use fire attacks.

You can even mix more than two to make even crazier combinations all while fighting orcs and goblins etc together. Careful *Friendly fire is on*.

You have like 8 different elements and have 4 different ways to apply them. The possibilities are crazy. Please try it."
PS5,vmy12c,(Rant) Battlefield 2042 is an embarrassment to PS5 and Gamers,"Finally got my hands on a PS5. One of the games jammed into the ""Fuck You, you know you're still gonna buy it...""-package I begrudgingly purchased was 'Battlefield 2042'. I've played the OG classics, Hardline was bad but playable, 1 was thin but fun &amp; V was a good time (loved the tanks!)... 2042 is an abomination. 

The menus are an absolute mess and navigating them gets me closer to having a seizure than any of the piss poor graphics ever could. Speaking of which, whoever OK'd the final rendering of this game should be excommunicated from the gaming industry and the artists themselves should really consider other work. So many glitches too...

The weapon selection is pathetic, you get more options at a Bed and Breakfast. The ability to swap attachments mid game is pretty sweet, but again who cares when there's only 7 guns in the game. The class system has potential, but the crap menu layout makes it super confusing to navigate and I just lose interest.  Why would you assign so many different buttons to navigate a damn menu? I feel like I'm trying to solve a Rubik's cube changing a weapon load out.

The maps are massive but designed almost as if they don't want you to use vehicles... And the vehicles! Why are there so few! And why are there fewer options than ever?! Weak sauce EA... Speaking of which... Fuck EA.

For a system that's supposed to afford endless possibility, I feel really handcuffed to a style of play that just isn't fun in a game that doesn't even feel rushed, feels incomplete. Was really looking forward to a new Battlefield but I'm trading this in for whatever they'll give me. 

Says it all that they had to ham-hand it into package deals. Thankfully it included Elden Ring too. That way I can play a game designed by people vested in providing their customers with a quality product. Fuck EA, their brand killing greed &amp; shitty products."

PS5,vmozn7,"Returnal sucks, and it's entirely my fault.","I enjoy the game, I enjoy the esthetic, the ambiance... but the story killed it for me. 

The game is smooth like butter. It took my one death to feel like I'd been playing for hours. The atmosphere of the game is amazing. I was getting some nice Lovecraft feels from it. It only took a few days to raise i wasn't going to finish it, I'm not usually a fan of roguelikes, but I have PS plus, so it was free. I little tidbits of plot the game gave me left me very intrigued so I hit up YouTube for a plot explanation video and that's when it really killed the game for me. 

Spoilers past this point. 

&gt;!Ok so the entire time I was getting those Lovecraft vibes I was excited. I was picturing some ancient evil awakening, some nether God that drove all the beings on the planet insane. Totally hooked. !&lt;

&gt;!Then I find out the whole things is in her head because she feels guilty for inadvertently causing the death of her daughter and being unable to save her. I felt ripped off. I wanted deities of unimaginable horrer psychically decimating every kind on a planet and delving further and further into the mental apocalypse that was there home...!&lt;

So yeah, that's why it sucks and it's entirely on me. Because my dumb ass wanted something other than what I got..."

PS5,vm0u6i,Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring.,"This is obviously my opinion so just keep that in mind.  


I've been a PlayStation first player since the early PS3-era, when the platform / first party was in the dumpster, and I was having lunch-time arguments in 8th grade about the merits of Folklore / Lair, over the likes of Gears of War and Bioshock...so in case anyone wants to question my bonafides there ya go.  


# Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring, and Ghost of Tsushima / Horizon are not nearly as good as you all say they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Some would claim that this started with the success of Uncharted and The Last of Us, but those games are phenomenal, and completely unlike the string of boring, predictable, safe, focus-tested, lifeless first-party exclusives they've come out with in the last several years.   


Horizon Zero Dawn  
Days Gone  
Ghost of Tsushima  
Horizon Forbidden West  
These games are all extremely similar structurally. Open worlds with lots of icons, objectives, gameplay variation...most of them have stealth grass, crafting, stealth kills, special melee finishers, loot, gear upgrades, skill trees, weapon upgrades...the list of familiar gameplay mechanics goes on and on. If you take away the window dressing of ""Samurai game"" or ""Robot dinosaur game"" or ""Zombie game"", they are almost identical in their design and gameplay, which is THE most important thing.

There are so many missions in Ghost that are trailing missions, or following footsteps...only to have a bunch of Mongol's be put in your way...you dispatch them and then the mission is usually over.

Horizon, despite having extremely awkward jumping and platforming, insists on making the player play dozens of missions that focus almost solely around jumping and platforming. Climbing on pre-determined, auto-win paths is not fun...it was the worst part of Uncharted and now it's in every Sony game. You want to see a game that did it right? Breath of The Wild...and I know that Guerrilla knows this game exists because they stole the glider mechanic straight from it.  


# Just because a game has a lot of dialogue and cutscenes doesn't mean the story / characters are good.

Aloy is one of the most insufferable game protagonists to come around in a long time. She is rude, humorless, talks down to people constantly, has no respect for the people around her, and worst of all she never shuts up or lets the player just play the game. I'd be rich if I had a quarter every time Aloy told a villager essentially, ""Shut up and let me handle this situation you toothless hillbilly...IF I HAVE TIME"". Who wants to play a game where the main character is an asshole to everyone?  


Jin Sakai, while not as much of an asshole as Aloy, is boring and bland as hell. He's conflicted about samurai vs ninja, but no matter what you do in the game, your choices don't matter and he ends up becoming a ninja anyway. Outside of being conflicted...what other terms would you use to describe Jin?  


Don't get me wrong - I think gaming is in a stronger place now than it's been in a long time, but god some of these games are so boring it makes my head spin."

NOT like SkinIt where the image doesn't go all the way around the controller, and *definitely* not a site like AimControllers where you have to pay extra for the base functions like Adaptive Triggers and a rumble pack."

PS5,vkw68j,Insufferable Lag?,"Never had problems on the PS4, but ever since I got a PS5 a month after it came out, it’s been constant internet issues.

I’ve already tried the following:
- Changing DNS servers 
- Changing to 5ghz
- Clearing the cache and database
- moving the console next to the router 
- cleaning the inside of the ps5 
- forgetting and reconnecting to internet 

And basically everything you could possible do. For the last few weeks everything had been fine and the PS5’s internet test has been giving me about 220-270 mbps, but ever since 2 days ago I’ve been getting about 14-25 mbps and I literally can’t play anything. Anyone have a solution?"
PS5,vkvu7s,Save Data Corruption,"Has anyone had a recent occurrence of save data corruption? It hasn’t broken my PS5 or ruined any game saves. But every once in awhile (maybe once every 2 weeks) I’ll turn my PS5 on from rest mode and I’ll see a message saying my save data for a specific game was corrupted. I then go into the message and it lets me choose between the cloud save or the console storage save. So far it’s happened for games such as Planet Coaster, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Deep Rock Galactic. Nothing is ruined so far but I have no idea why it’s happening and it only started after an April Software Update. Has anyone experienced the same?"

PS5,vkv2vc,[Xbox Gamer] FFVII Remake worth it?,"I'm mainly play on Xbox Series X, while extremely satisfied so far, 2022 will be dry, so I'll be back on it for MW2 Remake, and until Redfall &amp; Starfield.

Although, I finally got my PS5 recently! Got Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart and PS+ Premium (Ghost of Tsuishima, Returnal so far downloaded).

I never was a JRPG guy, I love Western RPG's (Skyrim, Witcher III, even the Assassin's Creed new formula since Origins) but I'm also a fan of Zelda, played all of the main franchise).

I've always hears about FFVII Remake and all the hype around it, I know the original was incredible for fans but I didn't have a PSone, I've started with PS2 and was mostly on Jak, Ratchet, Sly Cooper, etc...

Is the game really worth in your opinion for someone like me?

I'm thinking about Ocarina of Time in the way this game is perceived by fans of it, should I?

The tab for buying it is right in front of me and I can't be sure if I should make the purchase or not...

Thanks in advance."

PS5,vku7ji,How does upgrading to a higher PS Plus tier work after you add/stack existing 12-month Plus codes? I know a buddy who has 11 years of base Plus on his account and has an offer to upgrade it to Premium for $150 but I am offered the same upgrade price for my stacked 2 years. What gives?,"Is there a trick where there is a max charge to upgrade your existing stacked years of base PS Plus to Extra or Premium?  

I am just wondering why my offer is so close to his offer, for our remaining subscription, despite his having so many more years worth of plus stacked.  

By the way, I am comparing offers we both see on our consoles (both PS5’s).  

Is there any logic to this?  Does scaling take player where the more years you have stacked, the better the deal offered to upgrade for your remaining days?"

Today I was playing and the battery was low. So I've connected my DualSense to the charger to recharge it while playing and it wasn't recharging. My PS5 is updated to the last firmware as the DualSense. It charges from the phone charger only when the PS5 is off, or when the DS os not paired or disconnected from my profile. A friend of mine gave me his DS to try, same thing. It doesn't actually charge from ps5 neither while I am playing. What can I do to solve the issue? Thanks in advance."

Thanks,"
PS5,vkqso8,Don't get ripped off,"My wife had been wanting for me to get a PS5 for a while and I refuse to pay scalpers so I decided to wait until plenty titles had been released and I had all the games to play when I got mine eventually. It was our anniversary and Father's day recently so she kept mentioning trying to get one. We signed up for the Playstation website list and Amazon list about a week ago. No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase. 

I hope you guys get your PS5 too!"

PS5,vkdxxi,Best microphone for the PS5?,"When I had the PS4, I used the Astro A40 with Mixamp. Both the standard included mic and the Mod Kit Mic were crystal clear. The setup for the PS5 was wonky and didn't work for me. So I ended up getting the Pulse 3D at launch. The Mic is fine on that but nothing good. You get what you pay for at $100 truth be told. Works fine. I have tried the SteelSeries 7p+ ($170), just to have everything in the background comes through. Recently tried the SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless ($350), Just to sound low in my opinion unless I cranked it up in settings. Which allows more background noise to appear. Once again not practical to me. Without waiting for the PS5 version of Astros to drop. Which could be another year or two. 

Is there anything remotely good currently? That blocks out the background noise and only allows in your voice basically? Or close to it? The Pulse does a decent good job, but given the mic is built in, I sound like shit compared to the A40s or the Nova Pro Wireless."

I wanted to try out some exclusives to just get a feel for the PS before I decide to buy one, what games would you say are must plays in this period of time?

I did play GoW years ago on PS4 and I'm not really feeling Horizon, too much open world bloat for me and I got my fill on open world earlier this year with Elden Ring. Is there any considerable difference between Horizon and Days Gone or Spider-Man where that open world fatigue wouldn't set in? 

I'm willing to shell out some money for a game, but not trying to spend a bunch to try a couple different games when I don't own the console. 

Thanks in advance"

anyone knows, is there a PS application that enables per channel surround sound test? I would imagine that Blueray/DVD would work, but as I understand Blueray/DVD movie surround sound mode is different than gaming.

I have positioned my speakers according to the 5.1 DTS specification, my surround channels are all working fine, I does however seem to me that rear speakers have too low volume, same goes for DTS as Dolby. This is something I would like to test..

Thank you for any help. P"

PS5,vj1x32,"Ape Escape 2 is a mess on PS5, but why I have hope it will be fixed","So far the library of PS1 and PS2 is sparse. And personally I have no interest in the PS3 library through PS+ because my internet does not have the speeds to handle it. But if you have played Ape Escape 2 you'll notice a few things, that one it's the version that was ported to PS4 years ago when they did a short list of PS2 games for the PS4 early on the PS4's life. And two, it's broken on PS5 and they acknowledge that with a warning when you boot the game up which says to me that Sony knows that it's messed up on PS5. 

But why did I have hope they'll fix it? Because as said, the PS2 games that are on the service right now are the porter PS5 versions. For example Okage is the PS4 ported version dated from 2016. If you see the Jak and Daxter games they are also from the PS4 collection that was released awhile back. Unlike something like Ape Escape (the PSX original) that is dated for 6/13/22 here in the states, released again for this service. So I think that any further PS2 releases for PS+ will released for their service specifically, and again not like the few games they ported a few years ago on PS4. I think they'll fix Ape Escape 2 once they actually start getting to the PS2 games which will probably come with things like save states etc like we've seen with the PS1 titles.

And hopefully we'll finally get a rerelease of Ape Escape 3 since they rated it again back in 2020, but didn't release anything."

Now guys, that's all well and good, I don't want to blurt out on the PlayStation Plus topic, really I swear I'm okay with literally everything and everyone has their own opinion about it....but, holy HELL, but will you please explain to me what is the point of giving us """"""free"""" PS1 AND PSP games purchased digitally at the time, while PS2 AND PS3 games are not? I swear to you guys, I feel taken for a ride in an unbelievable way.

Either they were doing it for all consoles or not at all, but I say what's the point of doing it like this, half-heartedly, just for the content to make people feel good?

I am dumbfounded, I repeat I'm really okay with anything, 120$  a year for two games in a cross TO ME IS OK, everyone can choose whether to do it or not, no one is obligated....but there is a f\*cking limit to the transparency a company can have, and this is really one of the most treacherous and disgusting moves I've ever seen.

And don't tell me ""if you want to play PS2 and PS3 games you bought on the Store at the time get yourself a PS3"" because that's not the point, the point is the disrespect towards their fanbase, the wanting to take advantage of every last penny.

PS5,vht4f4,"I should love Far Cry 6, but I kind of hate it.","Far Cry 6 has a fun story and the characters are pretty excellent. There is a lot of heart in Far Cry 6's narrative, but the open world has no real soul, and the UI feels sluggish and dated.

Simply put, the things you do in the open world and how you are meant to traverse it--are monotonous. We all know what Ubisoft games are like so there's no need to go into great detail here.

I want to talk briefly about the UI.

When you start the game, you always get a voiced menu-narrator that says ""Press cross to start"" or something like that. At first it's like, cool accessibility. But you never have the option of turning it off. That's a little thing though, right?

But once you're in the game you start seeing those lazy design choices like having to enter the pause menu every time you want to switch your supremo device. Or having to drag your cursor around the menu screen to select things like you're playing with a mouse and keyboard. Or having to enter the pause menu again if you want to dismiss your companion.

What annoys me most though is how the main character can only grab certain ledges in the game. I frequently find myself stand right next to a fence or stairwell or rock that I can't climb because the game wants me to find the yellow painted wall that I'm allowed to climb to reach an item or vantage point. This is just egregious and a huge step back as far as modern open world games are concerned.

This game feels like such a contrast to Far Cry 5 which I feel had a really good balance of open world distractions and mission design; I was never really bored with Far Cry 5. (Hopefully it gets a console update).

I know this is all over the place.

TL/DR: Far Cry 6 is a waste of time."

PS5,vhr2bl,My Replacement PS5 - A LONG Journey,"So. Back in June 2021 I was lucky enough to get myself a PS5 (disc version) console for RRP without really trying that hard if I'm honest.

Flash forward from June 2021 to May of this year. The 12th to be exact. A day that will haunt me.

I had just installed Evil Dead The Game (E/D) and the new PS5 firmware update - like many people had I assume.

20 mins into E/D and the PS5 screen went black, an almighty ""scream"" type audio rumbled out of the speakers on my TV and the PS5 went off.

""Okay. That was weird. Damn game.""

Turned it back on and loaded E/D back up again. 

4 or 5 minutes later...

Green screen. PS5 powers off.

""What a dogsh** game!""

Threw the game back in the cupboard and put (I'm ashamed to say) Fortnite on. Played for 2 or 3 hours. No issues. 

A couple of days pass, maybe a week, during which I'm discussing E/D with some mates and how annoying it is that the game is unplayable.

""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Mine doesn't crash."" ""I've not had any problems.""

Not what I wanted to hear.

I do a bit of research. 

'PS5 green screen....' comes back with issues ranging from software, HDMI leads popping out or a bad GPU.

I keep telling myself that it was the game - Fortnite was okay. No issues at all. I decided I'm going to test it out again. I don't even get past E/Ds loading screen this time. Green screen. Power off.

I reset the console. Same issue.
I option 7 the console. Same issue.

ONLY with E/D.

I'm playing Far Cry 6, Valhalla, Fortnite, all without issue.

To be on the safe side I contact Sony through their online portal. 

I ask them outright if the firmware has caused this. Knowing a few people have had firmware issues previously.

They tell me to send it back if I like because it ""might"" be broken. Even though I'm playing it. 

""What!?""

They give me a case number. Let's say 666X666 and instructions on how to package my PS5 for return. (I'm in the UK - They give you a label and nothing else.)

There's no way it's broken though. I'm playing it whilst reading their email. How can they say it might not work when I'm literally playing it?

Flash another week. It's playing everything except E/D.

June 10th 2022. Or as I now call it. 

Sony PlayStation Fried-day.

It's 0830 and I just got in from a night shift. Figured I'd do some looting and shooting before bed so I turn it on. Fortnite loads because I want something easy.

30 seconds later. Green screen. Power off. Reboot. 30 seconds. The same. Reboot. 20 seconds. Black screen. (That's new). Power off.

I pull the leads out. Use a whole roll of bubble wrap and mail the PS5 at 1032 in the morning. Gone. 

When Sony give you your case number they also give you a link to track your return. That evening, just because I'm bored I type in 666X666 and my postcode. 

[In transit to us.]

Cool. 

I then check Royal Mail tracking who confirmed the same.

What follows is a breakdown of what happend next.

11th [In transit to us]
13th [In transit to us]
14th [You do not have access to view this page] 

I figured that was an error but I was away for a couple of days so wasn't spending hours on the phone sorting it out. Fired them a quick email anyway. 

Royal Mail told me it was delivered to the distribution centre but that's as far as their tracking goes because Sony then use a different service.

16th [You do not have access to view this page]

I had no choice but to call the number I got from Twitter.

Gave them all my details. Explained I'd been locked out of tracking to be told they'd received my unit on the 11th. So the tracking was wrong anyway. It was now at the repair centre and would be back with me in 14 - 21 days. Even though the website says 15 max. Okay fine. Doesn't bother me. I work a lot anyway.

17th June 2022 I received an email asking me to rate the service I'd received and informing me my PS5 was yet to be received but they'd keep in touch. I was confused. The person on the phone said they'd received it at the repair centre on the 11th. Now 6 days later they don't have it? 

Obviously I call them again to be told I don't exist. Not my tracking number. Me. They've no record of ever speaking to me via the phone or emails. Luckily I screen capped the emails which I promptly sent over.

18th June I get two emails telling me;

*Your PS5 has been received and the repairs team are working on it. 

*Your PS5 is still in transit to the repair centre.

I can't call them because the call centre is closed Sat and Sun - so I send back a very polite email explaining I will call them first thing Monday the 20th June and I want to know WTF is happening.

20th June and I give them a ring. I'm INSTANTLY put through to a manager. They don't even ask. They just tell me they're doing it as soon as I say who I am.

I explain that I'm fine with it taking 14 - 21 days - it doesn't bother me. I just want proper confirmation they have it as so far I've been told it's not there, it is there, I don't exist... etc

The manager tells me the following... 

""We recieved the console this morning at the distribution centre. It will be sent to the repairs centre today and you will have it back by the 28th June.""

Awesome. I thank him, hang up the phone and go about my day. 

1656 on the same day I receive an email...

""We are pleased we could assist you and are now closing your case.""

Closing the case? You've still got my console. I think not.

I try to call but they close at 1700 apparently. 

21st June 2022 I'm straight on the phone. 

The woman tells me that I received my console at 1029 that morning (yesterday). ""The f*** I have...""

She goes off to get a manager who spends the next twenty minutes calling me a liar and saying they have a signature, proof of delivery, etc etc 

I ask them to forward me an email containing all of this information and tell them I will be in London that afternoon, at their office to show them my security footage from my house.

Suddenly the manager says...

""Oh. Sorry. Your console will be there today between 1330 and 1530"".

I'm still angry from being called a liar and say;

""I still want the proof of delivery you have from 1029 this morning though. Ya know. My signature. A photo. Whatever it was you have there in front of you...""

He hung up.

1525 Brand new, replacement PS5 - in a brown box (no PS5 box) turns up and I don't even have to sign for it because the DPD drivers machine isn't working.

I genuinely believe that they knew the firmware messed it up, they had it on the 11th, they then lost it between the 12th and 14th and thought I wouldn't check - locking me out of tracking intentionally, didn't want to repair it and finally I think if I hadn't have caused such a fuss I believe they would still be maintaining I'd got it back even when I hadn't.

TLDR 

PS5 Blew up. Sony lost it. Claims I had it back when I didn't and had proof. Only when I mentioned my home security did they say otherwise. Replaced the console in a rubbish brown box."

PS5,vge2xl,PSA for PS premium subscribers: jak 3 is (technically) broken,"so as we all know, sony released the new ps plus tiers recently. and as we also know, the classics catalog is extremely barebones, which is disappointing. the ps2 catalog literally has only 4 games in it, and those are the jak and daxter games. ok sweet, those are some cool classics, and one of sony's most beloved mascot platformers. so with the lack of other ps2 games on the catalog, you'd think that sony would have done everything to make sure that these games are delivered to us in the most utmost condition right? WRONG! 

for those of you who decide to start paying 120 bucks per year, you need to know that this game cannot be platinumed for a large quantity of players, on both ps4 and ps5. trophies come with all 4 jak games, so they're clearly an advertised feature of the new ps plus service. well, this is just to let you know that many players out there, including myself, cannot get the platinum trophy because the game is glitched. 

if you attempt to platinum the game, you need to obtain all 600 precursor orbs, the primary collectible in the game, and ofc this has a couple trophies tied to it. problem is that gaining all of these is impossible for some people. there are numerous side challenges in the game that do not award their orbs upon completion. I finished doing the wasteland run race today, and despite beating the gold medal requirement, I wasnt awarded with any trophies for the challenge. i've tried replaying it numerous times, to no avail. and this isn't the only challenge that awards orbs either. im currently at 576/200 orbs and im a hundred percent positive that i've done everything that im supposed to do for all the other orbs. i've found all the collectible ones via youtube guides, and i've gotten all the orbs related to the various in-game mini games. but it would seem that some challenges do not properly give you the orbs, most notably the races. my high score tab in the pause menu has shown me clearing every single gold medal time for every challenge, and yet im still short on 24 orbs. for some people it might be slightly less, and for some slightly more. nobody knows what the issue is for sure because neither sony nor naughty dog have ever fixed this issue.

the game is currently running on version 1.02, and it doesnt appear to be possible to delete the game and attempt to play it on version 1.00, since you need to be connected to the internet to redownload the game, and doing so prompts you to download the most recent update as well, which presumably broke progression. it was originally released in 2017 as part of the jak and daxter bundle, and even now in 2022 this has not been fixed. for those who bought it digitally, this was already insulting, but the fact that sony chose to voluntarily put these games onto their new premium service which they're charging people for, just for them to find out that they cant obtain the platinum either, is a whole new level of disrespectful. you'd think that with the ps2 catalog being as pathetic as it is, they would have done everything in their power to polish these emulated games as much as possible. there have been numerous other threads made on reddit regarding this issue, but nothing was ever done. 

my hope is that this post can bring some awareness to this issue and get sony to release a new update for it, since they're essentially charging for an advertised feature that doesnt work properly for a lot of people. there are NO missable collectibles in jak 3, but some of them definitely are glitched, and need to be fixed ASAP, because this reflects poorly on sony."

I am not looking for solutions, I tried resetting it and all and I'm not going to unscrew everything in order to fix it because I still have the warranty.

Since I have the warranty there shouldn't be a problem but the store I bought the console will ask me to send the PS5 too. I do find to be an annoying process and I would prefere to send only the controller.

My plan is to buy a controller from the same store and switch the controllers but I don't know if there is any way for anyone to see if I switched them or not."

PS5,vfsynb,Activity Cards are still poorly implemented.,"We are 20 months into the console generation and the biggest ""innovation"" that came with PS5's new UI, the activity cards, are still wasted potential.

They seemed like such a cool feature pre-launch. Jumping in your save file right from the home screen rather than having to go through the game's main menu? Yes please!
Offering tips and tricks for when you get stuck or want to unlock a trophy? Awesome.
And so much more...

But let's be real, who actually uses them?

I think there are two main issues that need to be fixed ASAP:

1. Visibility: when you press the home button mid game the activity cards will immediatly pop up. That's great. But how about when you view the game from the home screen? E.g. in order to select the activity card that boots you right into your most recent save file. Well, you actually have to press downwards twice on the controller. That's terrible. You won't even be seeing the avtivity cards unless you actively seek them out. So I personally forget to use them most of the time eventhough I could boot into the game much faster.

2. Consistency: there is zero consistency between games. Is there an activity card for loading my most recent save? Are there activity cards with tips and tricks? How do these activity cards look like? I simply don't know. Because of that I can never build muscle memory like ""pressing down and square will always launch the activity card that boots my most recent save"". Instead I always have to search for the card I'm looking for... if it even exists that is.

Possible solution: Sony need to make a few mandates that all new games will have to follow. The most important one in my opinion is that there has to be a Resume activity card that boots you right into your save file. This card also has to be the first card you see when selecting a game from the home screen. Secondly Sony need to rework their UI to make it more easy to understand at a glance what an activity card does and they need to make it easier to view and select an activity card from the home screen. They should probably go even further and include a hotkey that will immediatly load your save file. E.g. loading your most recent save directly from the home screen by pressing the square button.

What are your thoughts?"

PS5,vfjrup,Elden Ring Bosses' song lyrics are not in any language and thus cannot be translated [ Info offiacially confirmed] Read attentively till the end.," Salve. I am a Latin student and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs.

The first one I analysed was 'song of lament, not a boss theme, (aka song of the bats) whose lyrics are indeed in Latin. I contacted the lyricist who wrote them 3 months ago and then (for my surprise) I was told that only those were written by that person. Then I published those Latin lyrics and their translation at the time (Games from Mars channel got them from me and thus fairly credited me in his video) and I was looking forward to finding another Latin song in Elden Ring. 

For that purpose,  I contacted some music producers who worked in Elden Ring and they confirmed that 99% of the lyrics in the game are not in any language at all and don't mean anything. 

I have recently published some of my conversations with them on r/eldenringdiscussion by the way.

The Elden Ring music producers explained that the lyrics were computer generated and adjusted to sound like ancient languages.

 In order to help my research on the use of random syllables to simulate ancient languages in game songs, I was given the official lyrics and I have been analysing them carefully. Check out Mohg's official lyrics for example:   [https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI](https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI)  

As you could see, some times the lyrics resemble Latin, but they are not in Latin. The goal was to simulate ancient languages songs to enhance the dramatic feel of the player's experience.

I know it may be frustrating to know about it, but I was told that process is quite common in video games actually.

Sadly a wave of fake news last week about 'translations' of Elden Ring Bosses song lyrics spread pretty fast. I talked to youtuber Vaati and (fortunately) he is aware those are fake translations. So be careful, let your ears know 99% of Elden Ring song lyrics are computer generated syllables created to simulate ancient languages songs.

Cheers,

PS5,vfiwlc,Why game should I get???,"I’m looking for something very good that I can play for a long time. 


I’m considering elden ring, I’m not great at videogames but if I grind I can probably become decent and the long one gameplay time is temping. I also have no friends lol so it may not be very easy finding ppl on Reddit that want to play with a not so smart beginner lol

Sifu looks very cool too. Ngl it’s possible that I’d get stuck and never be able to complete it. Not sure tho tbh. 

I’ve thought about uncharted or Spider-Man remastered but I’d be so bored even if it is higher quality. I also wondered about forbidden west but the gameplay time is too short tbh

There's no real action in this game except for you and the enemies.

Can anyone else please confirm if theirs is the same way and that this is normal? Sorry for worrying, i will feel much better if it is just how it is supposed to be.

Thanks folks! I hope everyone is doing well and having fun with their systems!"

When moonlight/light is hitting the bamboo it creates this weird white outline on the trees. It only is showing at certain angles but still a concern I don't remember seeing it before and hoping it has nothing to do with the console not being shut off properly.

And I have to power it off or it will force shutdown. I got on YouTube to see what the problem could be. That's when I noticed there are a lot of other people that are having this exact same issue. Which started about a month ago or so. Some think a software update caused this issue. I'm frustrated because I visit PS5 reddit page a lot to see what's new.. and to generally stay informed about things. But I haven't really seen any posts about PS5's overheating.

I think these come to regular stores in a month or so, but for now they're only available on PlayStation Direct's website.

Anyways, [here's a link to the album for it.](https://imgur.com/a/3WRBaSG) If you've ever removed the side panels to install an SSD, the process is exactly the same. If you haven't, it's pretty simple: Unscrew the base, pull up from the top corner and push towards the bottom of the console and it'll come off cleanly. It takes a bit more force than you might expect. Then you just slide the new ones in. It comes with instructions if you aren't sure how it goes."

PS5,veofrh,Which video game studios will Sony acquire next for PlayStation?,"These are the possible studios from the rumors I’ve heard. Capcom, Kadokawa, Konami, Sega, and Square Enix, .

Another one that’s pretty far fetched that, imo, is very unlikely is Ubisoft.

Besides predicting which studios they will acquire first, which studios, in your opinion, should they acquire? Which studios do you believe will help PlayStation the most to compete against Microsoft and their gaming subscription service?"

People have expectations when they see Naughty Dog logo  in a teaser trailer. Many would laught their asses of if they see something ""indie"" from them.

How about new, smaller studio that would cycle people between projects? Small platformer made by people from Naughty Dog and Insomniac games? Puzzle game made by Sucker Punch and San Diego studio? And so on...

I know it is stupid to think they just let people go at the same time they hire, and it would be smarter to just build new ""indie"" studio with new talent to focus on simple games. But it would be cool to see what kind of games all talented people at Playstation Studios could create together while having fun.

And to be clear, I love God Of War, Uncharted, and many other big budget game. Just some thoughts. :)"

I hardly played at all anymore so I just let him use my account and he's since built up a lot of skins/achievements etc on different games.

PS5,ve7ec3,Other storage and other math problems,"Hey everyone!
My other storage is getting way too big😳
I was sure Sony would roll out a patch for this buggy other storage of the console
Or tell us what that storage is for?
At the moment I have 3 games installed which take 200GB
And the other storage is taking 408GB 
+ Some saved files
And I can't update my installed games, not talking about installing new ones 😤

Now to the math part
I have 3 games
Ghost of Tsushima 59.32 GB
Apex legends 56.07 GB
AC Valhalla 72.93 GB
-----------------roughly-178 GB
And 2 apps
Netflix 431MB
YouTube 445MB

From my understanding that puts its somewhere in the middle of a sata3 ssd and a gen 3 m.2. 

Prices are pretty reasonable for gen3 m.2 these days so it wouldn't be outrageous to get a 1tb and enclosure. At the same time I could probably get a 2tb sata for about the same price, but that is only about 4Gbps, so missing out on a lot of speed.

My friends have speeds of up to 300Mbps while paying the same price as me

Are there any non-fixed providers in Australia or am I forced to pay $200 a month for a meer 100Mbps download speed?

If anyone can shine some light on this I'd really appreciate it as I can't find anything about it online"

PS5,ve1twl,Looking for a PS5 game with infinite replayability,"Greetings,

As per the title, I am looking for PS5 game recommendations that I can play forever without ""completing"" it.  What I mean by that is games like Civilization, Stardew Valley, driving/racing like Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, etc. I'd also prefer it to be a offline and solo game.

The idea is to be able to have one game I can always count on to be there; to be able to play without having it be one of those games where you finish the story and you're basically done with it. Even if its a dumb long RPG game like Soulsbourne or ElderScrolls games because eventually I could run through the game with each class/build. By infinite I truly mean infinite to no end. 

I'd prefer it to be a laid back/relax after a long day of work type of game.  Turn based would be nice or a chill adventure type thing like stardew where there is no pressure to commit so much attention for a long period of time, itd be nice to get up and move a bit here and there. Like getting up between races on mario kart or between days on stardew, in between turns on a turn based game.

I know it's a lot but my dream is to find this game that can satisfy my gaming itch no matter when it comes up."

I really like the mute button on the Dualsense 5 controller, but when I click it while connected to the Gold headset, I get a prompt saying it's not compatible. 
Are there specific headsets that it might be compatible with? 
Does the headset need to be wired? 
Or is it only meant to be used to mute the mic inside the controller (which I have turned off already)?"

PS5,vdzaq6,I Feel Like the New PS Plus Is Not Good Value for Money,"Hello everyone,

£10.99 for ""Essentials"" is a bit much, especially as you have to pay an extra £3 to access classics under premium at £13.99. 

A lot of people are raving about 400 games!!! But it's 2022. Most of these games are dirt-cheap now and you can buy a PS3 for around £60 with games on Ebay. 

Incidentally, I also feel the same about Xbox Gamepass - in that most games are dirt-cheap. Except they at least include EA, backward compatible catalog of original Xbox, 360 and Xbox One games for the same as Essentials at £10.99.

I know it's early days, but I don't believe in subscription based game passes. You'll argue, ""no one is forcing you to buy it"", but it has serious ramifications for the industry as a whole. It demotivates developers, subscription prices ALWAYS rise regardless of the economy, so you end up paying more. It's very telling that PS didn't even attempt to undercut Microsoft's Gamepass or factor in rising costs....hubris? I don't know."

The graphics are sharp and the tracks vibrant and it zips past at a really smooth 60 fps. I’ve been wanting a new fzero or wipeout for ages and redout 2 is exactly what I’ve waiting for.
If you’re fan of the wipeout games or indeed f zero, you should definitely check it out. Thumbs up from me so far."

I did read that they won’t be releasing their 1st party games to it at least at launch which is okay in my opinion, but do they have plans to release them there let’s say a year after the release date? 

I am also curious what you all think they will release there in the future as well as what you hope they release there, for me personally I hope they release Dreams on it at the very least. 

I know they aren’t going to try to directly compete with Microsoft in this area but still what do you think the overall goal of it will be as well as the quality of PS5 games that they will bring to it. 

I just upgraded myself for death stranding, demon souls, and also to try the cyberpunk demo, and I will try a few of the others I don’t have, but I do have all of the PS5 games on the list besides those two. 

Do you think we will get PS5 games every month or will it just be PS4 and old PS3 games being added, as well as Indie games?"

So, I guess my problem has been my tv.

If this is accurate I could use some advice on getting a new monitor/tv. I’m hoping to buy something about 32 inches for no more than $300. Does anyone have any recommendations? Should I look for a 4k? Should the response time for the monitor matter? What should I consider?"

For some more insight as to what I would like to achieve...

I plan on playing daily. Not interested I competitive online gaming at the moment. Depending on how I feel down the line I might try and pretend like I'm a pro. I don't care about story modes or season modes. I strictly plan on playing where I can collect/level up/trade/buy/sell/unlock players to improve my team. I have no issues with spending some money towards q game I will enjoy, I will not invest my life savings just to be able to have a good team that can be competitive. 

Please note, I currently own both games and have played a few matches of both games. In eFootball I focus on Dream Team and Fifa 22 I focus on FUT. I like the slower gameplay of eFootball more so than Fifa, but it is completely barebones as hell when it comes to any sort of customization and there is no marketplace to sell players. Fifa on the other hand looks way better, has better presentation and plenty of customization options including a market place. However the game feels to fast paced and the marketplace to me implies more money needed to be spent. I like aspects of both games, ideally if I could combine them to make 1 game I would. 

With that being said, short term and long term, overall, which game would you focus more on completely? I don't want to be bouncing between both. Based on what I've described and based on your own opinion/experience. 

Cheers"

One thing that I noticed is that the disc stopped making noise when the copy reached 99%. I hope this question hasn't been already made and some feedback would be very much appreciated.

PS5,vd3tns,PS5 keeps turning off.,"So I’ve had my PS5 for a year and a bit now and it’s recently started randomly turning itself off. It is, however temporarily fixable by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable. I thought  it may be due to the system overheating but there isn’t a single speck of dust on the outside of the console (like on the fans, the base etc.).

Should I get the console fully cleaned out or does anyone have any other ideas?"

Nioh was an absolute beast! If Bloodborne's producer is teaming up with Team Ninja for their next soulslike, I can't imagine how good this is going to be!

The game will be set in a dark fantasy version of the Three Kingdoms period and will feature a robust combat system heavily involving Chinese Martial Arts. 

Honestly? I've always wanted a sequel of sorts to Sekiro because of how acrobatic and satisfying the combat was, looks like my prayers have been answered! 😌"

PS5,vd1jb8,Ps5 is freezing,"So my bf got his PS5 early this year and it was working fine. After the update a few months back, it started to freeze. He sent it to get fixed but the same thing happened when he got it back. As soon as he connects to his wifi it freezes. 
His friend also just got a ps5 and took it to my bfs house to play. The same thing happened with his PS5. As soon as he connected to wifi, it froze. 
I got curious so I took my PS5 to his house. I got mine in 2020 when it was first released. I hadn’t used it in a while so I hadn’t done the most resent updates. It was working fine, but in order to play you need the updates. So after doing that, it froze. 
Does anyone know or have an idea what the issue could be? Also, the wifi works fine with Nintendo switch, tv and computers."
PS5,vd1ik4,"Soundbar users, what settings do you have enabled to remove audio lag?","Hello all,

I recently got a soundbar, but I have been noticing some lag between the audio and video. It looks like the sound comes in delayed. I made a posting on r/Soundbars but I figured it might be a good idea to post here too since I'm using my PS5, maybe someone knows how to fix my issue.

Here is my hardware setup:

PS5 connected to [Samsung TV's](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-55-class-7-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv/6401735.p?skuId=6401735) HDMI via stock HDMI cable

TV eARC HDMI port connected to [Samsung soundbar's](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/home-theater/sound-bars/hw-b650-3-1ch-soundbar-w-dolby-5-1-dts-virtual-x-2022-hw-b650-za/) ARC port (not eARC)

Here are the things I've tried:

The first thing I tried was using the optical cable. The manual does say to use a hi speed HDMI w/ Ethernet and I just grabbed some random, generic HDMI that came with a monitor I bought recently for my PC. That did not resolve the issue, audio lag was the same

My original setup was PS5 stock HDMI into Soundbar HDMI and then soundbar ARC HDMI to TV eARC so basically everything going through the soundbar, but that capped my PS5's resolution to 1080p which made the picture really crisp because it's a 4K TV, but everything was way over saturated and there were noticeable artifacts on the screen. I'm not sure if this was a limitation of the soundbar being ARC and the TV being eARC or if there were some settings I had to tinker with on both TV and PS5 but I didn't bother because originally I thought I was using it wrong having it hooked up like that

I tried audio sync on my TV, but that didn't seem to do anything, and audio sync on the sound bar only made it worse, and it was already set to 0. I thought there might be negative values like on the TV settings, but there weren't it only went from 0 to like 200 

I saw somewhere that switching to DTS Virtual X helps with latency but that didn't help with my situation.

I also went into my TV's expert settings and changed the audio output to Pass-Through (other options are PCM and Auto).

On the PS5 I also have audio options for PCM, Dolby and DTS. I saw somewhere that Dolby would be the best if I'm using ARC, but that didn't fix the issue. I did see a marginal improvement, but it was minimal, and the lag is still very apparent"

PS5,vd0jhx,Using Ps4 and Ps5 alternatively ?,"Can I use my Ps4 and Ps5 alternatively and keep my game data synced? The consoles would be in 2 different locations with the same Ps4 games on both consoles with the same PSN account on both. I'd like to know if I switch from one to the other if the data from my games will be updatedh if I use the UPLOAD DATA option. This way I could avoid hauling my console from one place to another.

Current examples of games are NHL 22 - Franchise Mode, Horizon Zero Dawn and The Division 2.

I play in one place during the week on the Ps4 and on weekends, Ps5 at a different location. 

I haven't found much elsewhere or on YT."

I think there may have been some confusion as to what I was claiming, so I would like to clarify: **PS1 Classics on the new PS Plus Premium service are the original 60hz NTSC versions in North American territories.** This is good.

**However, PS2 Classics are still the 50hz PAL versions for me when I download them onto my NTSC PS5.** This is not good. A notable example is Ape Escape 2, which is very clearly the PAL version as evidenced by the game's splash screen displaying [""Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Presents""](https://i.imgur.com/2MWrRj0.jpg).

[I'm also experiencing graphical glitches with the HUD](https://i.imgur.com/wqv74KL.jpg), which I also encountered last year when I first tried booting up this specific title on my PS5.

Basically, it would seem **Sony has not updated their PS2 Classic titles for PS Plus Premium, only the PS1/PSP Classic titles.** This isn't conjecture on my part, but a fact for me at least (N=1). I'm curious if anyone else has been impacted by this same issue. If not then perhaps Sony is rolling out NTSC updates for PS2 Classic titles in a staggered manner."

If your PS5 is completely offline and you put in a PS4 disc and let it install, can you run the game without having to connect to the internet? I only ask because when you put an Xbox One game into a Series X, it has to be connected to the internet to finish the install. I’m assuming this has to do with you having to have the latest game patch installed for proper compatibility. So does this same issue exist on PS5?

I should clarify that I’m not talking about the free upgrades to games, but simply playing a PS4 game on PS5. 

If somebody who owns a PS5 could check this for me, I’d be really thankful as I haven’t been able to find the answer I’m looking for online."

PS5,vcrm4h,Sony needs to add LFC (low framerate compensation)!,"Yeah just tried a little bit of the Resident Evil 2 PS5 Patch and I have that game on both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 and it’s really obvious that the PS5 has no LFC. The framerate in the raytracing mode often falls under 48 fps and on PS5 that creates clearly visible and distracting stuttering. The Xbox version also falls unter 48fps (from my limited analysis via the VRR information on my LG CX I would say they are the same performance wise, where PS5 falls under 48 fps and shows 59hz in VRR into Xbox is around 90 ± 3 fps in the info which makes it around 43-44 fps due to frame doubling) but because LFC is working it’s doubling frames and it’s much MUCH more smoother experience on Xbox. 

It’s a little but frustrating because I really would like to play 2 and 3 on PlayStation 5 (because I’m weird and Resident Evil are “Playstation Games” in my head, also DualSense!) but in this case Series X is clearly the much better experience. 

I really hope Sony adds system wide LFC. I know developers can add an own implementation of LFC similar to what insomniac did in Spider-Man but I believe it would help especially for third party developers to implement it an a system level.

Hope some people find this useful, there's some titles in there that I'd never heard of that have pretty decent reviews. Also, it's worth noting that a lot of these games are quite old and might not have scored as highly by today's standards, so KNACK is probably more of a 95 than a 100.

PS5,vcn2kh,Games still locked after restoring purchases.,"So I’ve had my PS5 for a few months now, and some games have always been locked for me such as Friday the 13th and Ghost of Tsushima. I’ve restored licenses three times, I’ve tried disabling and enabling Console sharing and offline play. But still some games remain locked, even though I’ve purchased those games. I’m not game sharing with anyone, and the only other account I have on my console is my brother’s, I’ve done the same thing on his account, still nothing. I’ve checked the web, and tried about everything I’ve seen, nothing, so please Reddit, I’m counting on you!"

PS5,vcknxo,Why Sony? Being a ps plus subscriber I have to pay for free upgrade.,"Recently Resident Evil 7 got a free ps5 upgrade.

As a PSplus subscriber, I already claimed this game but I can't play it because I have to pay extra for upgraded graphics.

That also means if Red Dead Redemption 2 gets an upgrade (free or not). I still have to pay extra if I claim it through PSplus.

Now I'm wondering, should I buy the game or play using PSplus?"

I ve seen some videos on youtube that when they go to users and accounts &gt; they have a tab called “users” (Also theres a option to add users straight from there) but mine says Delete users instead of users and I can’t add users from there. Why is that?"

PS5,vchyj7,How much should I expect to pay for a ps5 secondhand?,"I've been messaging this guy on kijiji who is selling a ps5, an extra controller, and a charging dock for 930 CAD.

It seems a bit too good to be true. On his side is the pictures he has, the fact he's willing to let me open the box and packaging, the fact that he has tons of positive reviews on kijiji (and very few negative ones about things like negotiation, which makes his reviews seem authentic), and that on his account he's selling a bunch of different gaming and electronic products, and his account is 2 years old and he's shown me a screenshot of an order confirmation for the bundle he's selling (so I can get warranty on the product in question), and that he wants to meet me in person and apparently has a very nice Mercedes (not too relevant but it adds to the fact that he seems like a well to do guy).

Only problem is I look at ebay and stockx and most ps5s are going for 950-1100 even without an extra controller (though some have horizon forbidden west bundled). 

Is this guy a scammer? Is he going to sell me a box of bricks or a bricked ps5?"
PS5,vchdk6,Is melee better in Horizon Forbidden West?,The melee combat in the first game really put me off it. It was really bad. Is melee in the second game improved at all?
PS5,vch3xi,I Miss the Old Era of Game Conferences," I feel like since COVID (and a few years before tbh) gaming presentations have felt so dry and stale. Whether its a State of Play, Summer Games Fest, The Game Awards, or even the Xbox Bethesda Showcase, I feel as if these have lost the magic they used to have. Obviously the pandemic has played a role, but the days of live audience reactions to a surprise announcement during E3 seem to be over and that makes me sad. For example, I think Sony's E3 2016 press conference is probably the all-time best gaming showcase/conference/show ever. It completely exceeded anyone's expectations, there were very few leaks, the theatricality of the show itself with the orchestra going into a LIVE 15 minute demo of God of War (2 years before it even came out!!). Could you imagine a showcase now showing a live 15 minute demo of a game 2 years before release now?? Not to mention the other great moments, like an exclusive Spider-Man game, the reveal of Resident Evil 7 being a first person survival horror game that no one knew was The Kitchen demo months before, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, Crash Bandicoot coming back, giving a date for The Last Guardian, Kojima literally walking out on stage and showing Death Stranding for the first time before anyone knew what it was. Bottom line, this conference was just full of surprises and amazing moments and I just don't think something like this will ever happen again, especially now with everyone doing direct-style formats for their presentations. Maybe it's just me but I've always enjoyed the live shows with an audience much more than these dry, corporate directs that everyone does now."
PS5,vch1qq,PSN Store Sales Tax Within EU,"I am currently living in Portugal, within the European Union. And my account is set to my country. Although every time I buy something from the psn store, the statement says it came from the PSN London. This makes it so that I have to pay a sales tax over the cost of the game. 

I haven't owned a Playstation console in years and this is new to me. But I'm pretty sure I didn't set the region to the UK. I actually double checked it to be sure. My account is registered in the country I'm living in. 

Is there something I possibly missed?"

PS5,vcfie7,DualSense noisy analog sticks?,"Has anyone else noticed this?

My original white controller that came with the console doesn't have any issues at all. 

However I've seen bought one of the newer black controllers and a blue one as well. Both have them have really stuff analog sticks that make a distracting creaking/clicking noise whenver you move them from their default position.

Tempted to return both of them but before I do, is this now normal? Not impressed with the build quality at all."

The voltage of the power brick is correct with a suitable usb-C cable that charges phones/switch etc. and when I plug it in it pulses orange, but it doesn't charge any more than when it was last used and the orange light lasts indefinitely (as opposed to turning off when fully charged). This is the same when the console is fully off, and when it's in rest mode. I've used multiple bricks and cables with the same result.

I can charge the controller when I'm playing, but only by turning it off, plugging it in, then turning it back on. This is the only way to get it to hold charge. I can also charge it via the USB on the console when it's in rest mode, but it's tricky to get the console so I prefer not to do this.

Anyone else had similar issues and found a solution? Never had any problem charging the ps4 controller from a wall socket, it's causing some issues not being able to do it with the ps5 as I don't sit near a plug or USB socket when I'm playing.

Cheers!"

So, I'm not a hardcore FPS player which is why I didn't not include the Scuff FPS Pro. I play a mixed bag of games thus I want something that will give me a little more responsiveness than the standard PS5 controller.

If you could please just give me your vote and your 1 favorite reason why I would greatly appreciate it Reddit family.

PS5,vcc23t,"Bummed you can't broadcast ""stream"" games","So my wife and I run a theme park YouTube channel - we focus mostly on Disney here in Southern California, but we also do the other local theme parks including Universal. We'd been kicking around the idea of doing some live streams playing games, as our current live stream base was interested in it. We'd been thinking about starting with the LEGO Skywalker Saga since it falls into our normal fan base. 

I had some new ideas today though with the release of the new tiers of PS Plus. I subscribed to the highest tier to check it out and noticed there were a lot of older PS3 era Disney games that could be fun to go back and mess around with on a live stream. I tried to do a test stream of Toy Story Mania only to find that since it's a stream game (no download option since PS5 can't emulate PS3 games) that you can't actual broadcast it using the built in PS5 hardware/software. I'm sure some of you already knew this - but it was news to me who was just trying it. 

It's not the end of the world, but being able to do it built in would have been nice, rather than going with a capture card and all that fun stuff."

But now that it's out my only option is to pay $4.07 for the upgrade for the remaining 15 days and then be charged $50 every 3 months. But that sucks. That means a year of premium that was would be $200.

PS5,vb91zj,"Kojima Productions issues statement on future with Sony, following news of Xbox deal", 
PS5,vb91o5,3rd party controller recommendations?,"So I recently purchased a PS5 controller to use on my PS3 as it is to common knowledge now that the PS3 is ridiculously uncomfortable however I'm still finding that the PS5 controller still give me pain in my right hand wrist after only half an hour of game play, does anyone have any 3rd party recommendations for people with big hands?"
PS5,vb8dct,I got a PS5 directly from Sony that came defective. I had to send it back and they cannot replace it. Here are my thoughts about it.,"I got selected to buy a PS5. It came defective and I spent my whole weekend over the phone with Sony support to try and troubleshoot it, and hours on forums and watching YouTube videos to fix it. I legit had to **return** my PS5 and they couldn’t promise a replacement. I’m heartbroken, but here are my thoughts about the current generation consoles:

I became a PlayStation “fanboy” when I got my PS4 Pro over the Xbox One X. Before that I only had Nintendo consoles. I grew up with the GameCube.

The reason I got a PS4 instead of an Xbox was because of the quality and exclusive games it had, the large user base, and Sony’s pro-consumer practices. Xbox One X barely had any notable exclusives and Microsoft was anti-gamer when the Xbox One first released. They had Halo, Forza, and Minecraft. Sony had God of War, Horizon, Spider-Man, The Last of Us, Uncharted, and more.

Now, the Xbox Series X is more powerful and has more memory than the PS5 at the same price. Microsoft went haywire with acquisitions and now boasts Starfield, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, DOOM, and more. The Xbox Series X also looks much better than the PS5, in my opinion. Microsoft has finally become pro-gamer once again but it seems like it’ll probably dominate the gaming market in the long term. Microsoft vastly overpowers Sony.

So I’m stuck here, deciding whether or not I should get an Xbox Series X or a PS5. I want a 1 terabyte PS5 that isn’t massive it takes up a quarter of my TV stand. I’ll also probably get it just to play God of War; but then again, most of these games are releasing on PC anyway."
PS5,vb82xq,What's a Category/Genre that's missing in Sony's Single Player Narrative Games?,"God I really need a MGS/Splinter Cell Tactical-Espionage stealth game made by a Playstation Studio. Maybe from Santa Monica Studios or Sucker Punch. Are there any single-player genres that you think we need?   


Maybe a Midnight Club open world racing story-game focused on street races and violence? I also wouldn't mind a badass undercover cop game similar to Sleeping Dogs and a futuristic open world game that's even more futuristic than CyberPunk with flying cars and etc similar to Fifth Element.   


What would you like to see?"
PS5,vb80g1,Elden Ring Update 1.05 Patch Notes, 
PS5,vb7ka4,Recommended games for a someone known for not finishing games (Including backwards compatible)?,"So I have my PS5 for like 8 months now. So far I have played alot of FIFA, uncharted 1-3 and TLOU1. 

I have tried GOW and Uncharted 4 but somehow these didn’t stick with me and I have never finished them. 

Including the PS3/PS4 I haven’t finished alot of games. The ones I can think of are uncharted 1-3, AC2-revelations, TLOU1, GTA IV.

I like to get my moneys worth out of a game, so $60 for a 10h games just seems expensive for me. But when I play a 100h+ open world game I just get overwhelmed. I love a good world and an emotional roller coaster. Thats why I loved TLOU1. 

Including the PS4 games it looks like RDR2 would fit my needs but the open world scares me. TLOU1 is so nostalgic to me the mixed reviews of TLOU2 scare me. Elden Ring looks dope but I disliked the fighting mechanics in GOW (while I loved the world). 

This is starting to feel like a rant but I really want to gey away from the grindy FIFA/COD hours and wanna get invested in good story games but I dont know where to start 😂"
PS5,vb72ou,Judging by Microsofts game showcase Sony is spot on about subscription model ruining quality of games,"Microsoft and Bethesdas showcase to put it blunt was a disaster.  This was the time for Microsoft to show what spending billions got them and it was a huge disappointment.  Starfield looks good but I won't believe anything Todd Howard says anymore.  

What became clear is going all in on Gamepass has hurt the quality for Microsoft. No big announcements and big heavy hitting games anymore. It's all just Meh. This is why I dread Sony eventually putting everything on PS Plus new revision.  

Sony stick to your word and keep big quality exclusives off subscriptions."

PS5,vb54a1,PS5 VRR on Samsung QN90A - Color slightly off?,"Hello Reddit,

I recently got the PS5 and Samsung's QN90A. My tv supports HDMI 2.1 (4K 120FPS) and with one of the PS5’s latest updates, VRR on said PS5. However, and maybe I’m just crazy, I’ve noticed that there is a slight change in color (or brightness?) when VRR is on vs off, and I’m not even talking about when you set it to 4K 120FPS VRR, which sets the color from RGB to YUV422.

A good example would be Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. When VRR is turned off (Just 4K, RGB, 60FPS, &amp; HDR), the color really pops. His orange fur is really vibrant, and the shadow detail is really good. However, when I turn VRR on, the colors seem a bit subdued. Like Ratchet’s fur isn’t as vibrantly orange as it is when the VRR is off, and the shadows seem less dark. It’s hard to describe, but there is a definite, if slight, difference in the colors/shadows/(brightness?) when VRR is turned on or off while playing Ratchet and Clank, and even AstroBoy.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is this the nature of PS5 VRR or is there a setting I need to change on my TV or some third option?

Also, kind of related, can you see a difference between RGB and YUV422?"

PS5,vb396g,Any fun games not open world?,"I’ve got loads of open world games as they’re my favorite but lately I feel I have everything and yet haven’t completed many of them. I’m gonna start knocking many off my list but I don’t wanna get burnt out. Anyone have good recommendations for non open world games? They just have to be fun and different, been looking at deaths door, dmc5 and paint the town red rn but not sure if there’s anything else out there? Would appreciate recommendations"
PS5,vb32d7,PS4 is stuck on data transfer,"Even though I finished my data transfer like a week ago, I tried going on my ps4 today and it still says its transferring data.

PS5,vb2cho,Left analog on one of my DualSense seems have too much give? Any suggestions?,"I’ve noticed it lately and the controller is fairly new hasn’t been dropped, but the left analog seems to be a bit loose for my liking or have too much give. Any suggestions to what this may be?"

PS5,vb1dds,Better Experience?: PS5 Remote Play on PS4 Pro vs PS4 Versions of Elden Ring &amp; Horizon Forbidden West,"I apologize if this has been asked before, but I was curious what the better experience would be in this situation. I just got a PS5 with Elden Ring and Horizon Forbidden West (PS5 Versions). While my wife hogs the TV with the PS5, I moved the PS4 Pro into the other room. I recently started using the ""Remote Play"" feature, and have been controlling the PS5 via the PS4 Pro in the other room on the same network. Everything seems to be great so far. I also notice I have free download of the PS4 versions of the same games, so I figured I would install to see if there's any difference. Would the experience be better or worse to play the PS4 versions instead of doing remote play? I realize the PS4 Remote Play is being streamed wireless over the network, so there could be some type of input lag or something like that. Curious to get your opinions. Thanks!"

Elden Ring really made it worse and with that game I can’t play more than 20 minutes without a hard crash.

Recently tried downloading cyberpunk PS5 version and crash before I even got to gameplay. Now the same thing with the Quarry, couldn’t get past the first segment of the game without a crash.

Now they have the Persona series coming to gamepass. What’s next? Spider-Man 2 and god of war day 1 on gamepass? Unfortunately is it time for me to say goodbye to the ps family.

PS5,vas67n,Why are there exclusive titles?,"I never understood this. And it seems like PS is the last platform to have exclusives (besides PC due to console limitations). Personally, I don't even really understand the point of gaming consoles anymore. To me, it seems like their time would be better spent developing gaming PCs with their own operating systems. It's not like the price is that far off anymore. Consoles are a very outdated idea and I think if they were smart, they would move on to another idea after this generation of consoles. Microsoft seems to be moving toward this direction as they implement their xbox game pass for PC. I'm not seeing Sony do much with PCs. Why are they still all in on console when a PC can play games the same as a console, while having all the other features of a computer.

But either way, having exclusive titles seems a little weird in this day, with so many other platforms and more and more people owning a PC than ever before, it just doesn't make any sense. Why would a developer choose to leave out everyone who doesn't use a PS5? Why are they leaving them out when other triple AAA developers are letting people use whatever platform they want to use. In fact, I can now play steam games and xbox game pass games using my phone and a bluetooth controller wherever I go. Sony is the only one that is stubbornly sticking to console and still accepting exclusives.

P.S. I can't wait to see the downvotes from all the people who can't have a discussion without losing control of their emotions and getting angry when someone has a different opinion. Show me how much of reddit you have plagued."

PS5,vargd1,[USA]K2/Sony are blocking The Quarry PS4 Standard version in the US for those who shop outside of the PS4's console storefront.,"**EDIT:** **I console share with my roommate/brother who has my old OG PS4 after I got my Pro version but now I switched over to the PS5. This is how I ended up in down a rabbit hole.**

After doing research with friends in the EU, US and UAE, K2 and/or Sony has (purposely?) blocked US players the ability to purchase the PS4's Standard Edition IF you're not actively searching/buying on the PS4 console's actual environment/storefront. Buying the Standard PS4 edition while on the PS5 is not possible UNLESS you get the DELUXE. 

Before the launch, you could have per-ordered the PS4 Standard port while on your PS5 and you could also leave it in your cart. After launch, the game was removed  from my cart.

Pretty much you have to be on your PS4 to be able to purchase the PS4 Standard Edition port. Outside of this, if you try to buy it via the PS5 console's storefront, the web, mobile or the mobile app, you cannot find it OR you get rerouted to a black screen with "" Not available for purchase"" if you follow links from the game's official site.

Example here: [https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI](https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI)

In the EU, you're able to buy the port while on the PSN storefront from the web/app (and I am guessing the PS5 too?) with out issues:[https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv](https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv) 

Xbox does not seem to have the same ""issues"" at all, here: [https://imgur.com/gVud3Px](https://imgur.com/gVud3Px)

When you're on PSN's page and you're searching for The Quarry on a browser, the tab renames itself to 'Access Denied' when the search results pop up regardless if you're logged in or not. [https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU](https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU) 

While cruising through these 6 pages, all that does come up are the DLC, the PS5 port and the Deluxe PS4/PS5 port bundle only.

From what I was told on our Discord, the UAE is having the exact same issues. Keep in mind that I cannot 100% back up this claim as I have not been able to properly investigate it. 

Does ANYONE know why this would happen, if it's intentional or not. I am guessing IF it is by design, it has to be on Sony's end as Xbox does not have the same thing going on."

Tlou2 does not do that. The remake is built on the same engine as 2, so that should mean that the 2 probably could get a patch soon-ish with ps5-short load times and haptic feedback. Today, 2 is ps5 only in the sense that it has framerate unlocked as it is running in ps4 pro-mode (I assume).

And since the remake is on its way to pc, I guess that work also enables 2 to hit pc at a time that is more set by marketing and business decisions rather than technical limitations."

PS5,vaf4sj,Recommended Games for 1st Time PlayStation Owner?,"Hey everyone! I'm a first time PlayStation owner. I'm looking for game recommendations.

A bit about me. I've always been a Nintendo player. I go for games that are cutesy (Kirby, Pokemon), challenging (Metroid Dread, Hades), and have a unique art style or are just praised and stand out in a way (Inside, Short Hike, Journey, Shadow of the Colossus). I don't usually go for games that have this realistic, gray atmosphere to them and things like Destiny, Call of Duty, or sports games really interest me.

The games I have now are Elden Ring, the 2 Spiderman games, and No Man's Sky. I bought the PS5 for Elden Ring. I'm really into the game's open world and world building. It's one of those cases where the game is just so good I don't mind the more grim, realistic art style. I will say I do take breaks from it cus of how intense it is. I love Spiderman for the traversal. I'm interested in No Man's Sky exploration. I was overwhelmed by it at first though because it was my first game on the PS5 while trying figure out the interface I was also trying to figure out the PS5 controller.

I'm interested in the Talos Principle but I can just borrow it from a friend. Gonna get Shadow of the Colossus at some point. I would get The Last of Us but I never thought I'd ever get a PlayStation so spoiled it for myself by reading it online. I also really enjoyed Astro's Playroom.

If you have any recommendations for me, let me know! I'm excited to join this community!"

The really irritating thing is that as the second failure was out of warranty period, I have to pay for a new controller but there is only three months warranty from the PS repair clinic.

I love applying critical theories to media and thoughtful analyses of problematic BS in games and movies and all media, and I do find a lot of things problematic in the media I consume (inappropriate accents and racial stereotypes in games KILL ME for example) but if you don't play a game and think it's problematic immediately upon hearing it's basic premise or plot, you're a pretentious faux-intellectual asshat is all you are.

In this particular situation this person who watches dating reality shows (UMM PROBLEMATIC FOR PROMOTING AN EXCLUSIVELY MONOGAMOUS POV?) and all sorts of shit that I would never bother with accused me of buying into pro war propaganda by playing Fallout games without ever playing any of them for even a second, and I'm just like wow no wonder everyone sees you as a downer and no one likes you.

What the fuck kinda way is that to respond to someone talking about a game or book or movie ""oh sooo problematic"" when your own diet of media consists of trash like Love Island.

Fuck the haters, and enjoy your games, I just wanted to vent, maybe others can relate?

Yesterday I stayed home from work the entire day waiting for fedex to deliver my PlayStation 5. I was home watching tV and I got a notification that my package was not delivered because I wasn’t home. I called FedEx immediately because I was home and I have a doorbell camera so I know for certain there was no delivery attempt made.

FedEx apologized and said they would try again tomorrow.

I waited on my front porch for the whole morning the next day. I was determined to get my package. I saw the driver pull up and turn off his truck. He clearly didn’t see me because he didn’t look, and then started his truck to drive off. I quickly ran to the truck and called him out asking for my package. After about 10 mins of him saying my package was on a different truck I insisted he checked and he “found” my package in his truck.

The insistence that he didn’t have my package in my opinion was most likely him hoping I wouldn’t challenge him so he could make away with my ps5. Walmart stupidly labeled the outside of the box with a ps5 logo so of course he knew what was in the box. 

I can’t think of any other reason that he would park outside my house and not deliver a package than to steal it and make it look like delivery was attempted.

Get your shit together FedEx"

https://i.redd.it/yr94nqhhqqr51.jpg

Appreciate a flat design might impede airflow as there would be no direct under channel of air the rear and any design would need sufficient venting to compensate for this making them a little uglier than they would be anyway. But for those that have the console horizontal flat plates would be crazy useful. If they were black the console would be pretty much camouflaged anyway. 

I know there are a million third party/unofficial plates out there but has anyone thought to manufacture any flat ones yet?"

PS5,v99jf3,The Quarry’s Darkness Settings Are Out of Wack,"So I recently got The Quarry and I noticed that the game was just too dark. Even after turning up the max brightness and hdr brightness in the game, the game was still crushingly dark. My oled TV’s settings are on point and I never had a problem with any other game. 

So I toyed around with the TV’s black levels and the ps5’s rgb range but still the results were unsatisfactory. Also, the game goes from dark to grey-ish brightness between cutscenes and interactive moments. It’s so jarring and weird. I am at a loss at what to do because it’s really distracting for a game like this.

That's not my question though.

So the brief history is that the original Bladestorm: Hundred Years War was release in 2007. Then in 2015 the Nightmare version (a remake with a new mode, but also graphic/gameplay enhancements I think) was released on ps4, xbox, pc.  

If you look up reviews of Nightmare you'll see shiny updated graphics and the new Fantasy mode. 

When you play/stream the PS Now version of Bladestorm: Nightmare; I'm like 99% sure it's the dated 2007 Hundred Years War version. This is both odd and frustrating, because the title card clearly states ""Nightmare"". 

Okay if that wasn't odd enough, apparently this PS Now version, purportedly released in 2015, \*\*does\*\* have the new fantasy mode.

PS5,v96zdp,LG OLED C1 and PS5 HDR - HGIG VS DYNAMIC TONE MAPPING,"Hello guys,

After doing one of the best things in life (getting a 77 inch LG OLED C1) , i managed to get my hands also on a ps5. So currently i am trying to find the best settings for the HDR and i came to these recommendations :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve\_been\_doing\_ps5\_adjust\_hdr\_wrong\_heres\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve_been_doing_ps5_adjust_hdr_wrong_heres_how/)

and on this

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the\_definitive\_guide\_to\_setting\_up\_your\_tv\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the_definitive_guide_to_setting_up_your_tv_for/)

Based on Vincents guide and with having in mind that your TV supports HGIG.

I know also many people swear by HGIG over Dynamic Tone Mapping HDR but the truth is that some games like Assasins Creeds Origins still look more colorful and vibrant on the Dynamic Tone Mapping (at least when i tested in on my old ps4 pro) HDR instead of the HGIG option.

So setting up my HDR on my ps5 based on these recommendations above would make HGIG also brighter and more colorful on games like Assasins Creeds Origins or i should changing to DTM for such games?

If so the ps5 hdr setting should be remain the same or adjust them accordingly?

Btw i had the impression also that the ps4 pro HDR was a bit more Vibrant than the PS5...though it might my idea but i'd like to hear your opinions on too that!"

PS5,v92gc3,I’ve said it once and I’m saying it again Naughty Dog with Multiplayer for TLOU2 could make one of the best Battle Royales out.,"
I’m not a fan of Battle Royale but I really liked TLOU Multiplayer and it was basically mini Battle Royale. With Naughty Dog polish they could have a mega hit multiplayer if they would have a Battle Royale mode with infected scattered around the map. 

I’m picturing Teams showing up all over the map in trucks to enter the map and start to scavenge for supplies like single player and factions. What would set this apart however is infected of all kinds scattered around and you would have to be quiet and not alert them. Or maybe set traps for other Teams. With the games setting the options are endless. I think it would be amazing honestly. The basics are already in TLOU 1 they just expand the map and add more players and infected. 

And not saying this would be only mode of course have factions also. 

Only thing is the map shrinking mechanic not sure what it could be"

And it's the bad type of turning off, where it's not going into rest mode, but it's turning all the way off and when I turn it on again it goes through the database or whatever scan and then says my PS5 was improperly turned off.

I really don't think (and/or hope) it's an overheating issue, but I'm not sure of other reasons it could be happening, and/or what to do if this continues.

Any possible ideas?"

I want to be able to take advantage of HDR to it's fullest so if I play GoW (or any game for that matter) @ 4K 60fps, does that mean I won't be in HDR mode? My TV does say it's in HDR mode though.

Question I have is, am I still in 10bit HDR if I do game at 4K 60fps 4:4:2/4:4:0? Or does it go down to 8bit? If so, is 8bit still considered HDR? Or am I way off in my understanding?

Lastly, does playing in 4K 30fps allow it to be 4:4:4 10bit? My assumption is yes. So the last question I have is there a perceptible difference in color and HDR quality for 4:4:4 vs 4:4:2/4:4:0? In other words, does playing in 30fps vs 60fps warrant the color degradation?"

I bought my ps5 recently, I've had a UPS that i used for my ps4 pro, it worked fine so i just hooked my ps5 to it. It worked fine for the most part. I didn't have a problem playing ps4 games on ps5, the ps5 didn't shut down on power outages or anything, it was great. But everything went bad when i started playing native ps5 games. Anytime i had a ps5 game open (the two examples I tested were next gen cyberpunk and the matrix experience) the console would always crash during electric outages 100% of the time. The problem seems to be the fact that the transfer time from regular power to battery is too long for ps5 to handle specifically when playing next gen titles.


I tested multiple different UPS with different capacities, any of them that had simulated sine wave signal didn't work. The only thing one that worked was a UPS that uses real sine wave signal without any transfer time to battery. This was further confirmed by my friend who lives in the same area and has a ps5 with a simulated sine wave signal as well.

Tl;dr for anyone dealing with this as well since there isn't enough coverage, a simulated sign wave UPS isn't good enough, you will need a sine wave UPS to use your console."

PS5,v8ofrt,Resetting ps5 bought at garage sale,Bought a ps5 at a garage sale. Seller was in his 50s-60s. I got a decent deal on it. I turned it on and everything worked. Issue is it has some decent games already on it but it keeps asking me to sign in. Obviously I don’t know the password. Is there any way to get around this possibly change the login. Or would doing a factory reset in safe mode (where I’d loose all the games and data) the only thing I can do to reset it and use it? Thanks for you’re help.

PS5,v8kjta,PS5 Not Finding Networks,"I've had a PS5 since Xmas and so far I haven't had any issues with it. The other day, however, I started having issues with it being able to find networks. I've tried every solution I found online and none of them have been helpful so far. Turning off the PS5 lets me use the internet for a short period of time, but so far every time, ranging from a few hours to the better part of a day so far, it eventually goes back down. I am pretty sure at this point that the issue is the wifi card on the PS5 itself because it won't detect any networks, not even my phone hotspot despite it being right next to it, but I don't know what to do to fix that. Are there any replacements I can get for it? Any other recommendations that don't include all the usual basic stuff I keep getting? I've tried literally everything I can think of, every solution I've found online that seemed plausible."

PS5,v8h34n,Why are my graphics are trash,So I’ve got a ps5 obviously with a bush 4k tv however for some reason my graphics just look awful. The colours are kind off the screen is kind of blurry and when I play horror games its way to dark I try playing around with the gamma in the games but when I make it bright enough just to see it makes my game look crap. I’ve tried to look online and I’ve done some of the things people are saying to do but my graphics still just look trash. Idk if it’s the tv or the ps5 that is messing my graphics does anyone have a suggestion of how to fix this
PS5,v8ft96,The gaming industry has changed,"The gaming industry has come a long way in my lifetime. Going from 2D to 3D. Offline play to online. Now virtual reality. As much as these achievements are great. Much sinister things lurk. 
Buying a game before meant you bought the game. End of. Now I agree that updates are great to iron out any deficiencies. But now days the games that get released are broken. At least most of them are. The GTA trilogy. Every fifa. COD. Battlefield. It seems that getting a game out on deadline day is priority. No matter it’s condition. And some get even more broken as the year goes on. Money is the driving factor. Get it out. Make profit. Then try fixing it. Games are bait now days. Getting the best achievements came from grind and hard work. But now they dangle the best achievements in front of you for the small price of half a pint (£2.50). This is their market. And everyone is falling for it. It defeats the object of actually playing the game. Take GT sport for example. Yes you’d have to put some hours in to get the best cars. But it was doable. GT7 has now made that almost impossible. You’d have to put in 40 hours just to get one car. But you can have that car now if you pay a small price. The gaming world in my opinion is in its worst place. Games that used to compete against each other to out sell one another. Now it’s just make a few things up. Get a fancy promo video done for it. And what doesn’t work. We’ll try and fix later. The passion has gone. Corporation ruining the experience as it taps up little kids to spend all their birthday money on the best stuff. After already paying £70 for the game."
PS5,v8fhx0,I finally secured a PS5 from Best Buy! Picking up on Saturday and I’m so excited!!,What are the first games I should buy? I’m definitely getting Miles Morales and MW2 when it comes out. Also not sure if I should buy digital or physical games. Any thoughts?

I have a Keychrom K4 V2 keyboard and a Logitech G305 mouse.

I’m finding it difficult to find results online on whether or not they will both work with the PS5, does anyone here know?"
PS5,v8ex2o,what is the ideal release schedule for big games? would you rather have a new game every few months or a strong summer/holiday season with several games at once?,"summer and holidays used to be the best time of the year and i prefer the second option: an avalanche of great games to tempt me to spend a lot of money at once

i remember christmas time in 2001 or 2004 where a lot of incredible games released at the same time

when PS2 got GTAIII, FFX, MGS2 and DMC all ""at the same time"" and when GC and XBOX were just releasing made a huge competitive difference and set the pace of the generation

same with GTASA, HL2, DQVIII, MGS3, GT4 etc.

that kind of scenario set my mind as regards when to expect the best games - now it feels weird if an important game gets released in for example february which used to be a very weak month

and recently maybe christmas isnt just that big of a deal?

would i have cared more about HFW if it had released in december?

i hope GOWR is announced for november - it would be great to have something to look forward to this year"

While understandably the graphics quality is much different than DS, Im having constant textures pop in issues. After a little digging, I can see the PS4 version was recommended over the PS5 version for better performance. 

Is it still the case? Or this was patched? I might trade in my ps5 version and swap it with the PS4 disc.

Thank you."

Im also part of Nintendo and Xbox and have never seen such behavior there. The regular PlayStation subreddit is also fair. But sadly, you can reach (thats the reason why we post) more people here. 

Either 1 Mod thinks he is funny with deleting posts for a quick power injection or something is completely off here. 

Again, thanks for any answer. 
You can reach me via DM too of course. 

If I dm you, you will 100% just ignore me. That’s why I try it this way.

Sequels to Killzone and Resistance would be cool. But part of me wants to see franchises like Socom and Syphon Filter make a comeback on current gen. And also would love to see brand new multiplayer franchises born under these great developers."

PS5,v7ttxa,PS5 Dyling Light 2 echoing/reverb audio,"I have a quick question for the community, I just got dying light 2 for the ps5 and every bit of audio sounds like its coming from someone at the end of a tunnel.  If I'm directly in front of someone, they sound fine.  But if I look away even a few degrees they get this really heavy echoing reverb effect.  I looked at all my reciever connections, ps5 settings, and in game settings and I'm pretty damn sure it isn't me.  Plus, the fact that it's only when I turn away from the source of the audio is when it kicks in makes me think is purposeful.  Some weird attempt at surround sound maybe?  But it sounds so awful there's no way right?  It kinda sounds like how in a souls game if you start to walk away from someone talking you get an echoey effect because youre hearing them in your head (or at least that's the effect I always figured they were going for).  But it makes zero sense in this setting, and when there are 10 npcs all standing and chatting in different parts of the room is disorienting as all hell.  And again, sounds just awful.  Is this how it's supposed to sound?  Or do I need to play with my settings/connections more?  If so, any reccomendations?  As a FYI I've not had this issue with any other game currently on my ps5."

As someone who uses this feature in a few different games, its quite annoying to go into the Accessibility Settings every time I switch games, when it could just be in the quick menu like it was on PS4.

Also while we are at it:
- It would be nice if we could save different profiles for different games, so we don't have to reset and reasign the buttons when switching games

- There should be a checkbox to toggle whether the custom assignments should be active globally or only in games"

PS5,v7ona6,PS5 Turning Off From Rest Mode,"I’m not sure if this is a common issue or not, but my PS5 is having issues turning on from Rest Mode. I have my PS5’s SIMPLINK setup in settings and the same for SIMPLINK on my LG C1. My PS5 is also always in Rest Mode and I’ve never had issues with it before until recently. However, when I try to turn on my PS5 (from Rest Mode) with my DualSense by either tapping or holding the PS home button on the controller, the PS5 turns on simultaneously with the TV but once the display for the TV turns on, the PS5 automatically cycles back into Rest Mode…from Rest Mode.

I’ve shut down and unplugged the PS5 entirely and turned on/off SIMPLINK multiple times on both devices, and both devices are updated to their latest system software. The only thing I haven’t done is reset my PS5 because I don’t want to unnecessarily risk losing game save data if I don’t have to.

I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong or differently than I always have (I’m not), or if this is a software issue that can be fixed in a future update, but I’ve never had issues with Rest Mode on my PS5 in the past year that I’ve had it. Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any solutions?"
PS5,v7ogbx,"Confused between digital vs disc edition to get, I have few questions","I have never used any console previously. I have so many questions. please bear with me

1. do games run directly from the disc or they occupy space in the ssd?
2. how disc games update when a new game update is released?
3. How do DLCs work in disc version? do I have to buy the DLCs digitally?
4. how save games and achievements(or trophies) work? are they tied to the disc or my user account on PS5? If if buy a disc, play the game, sell it, buy it again, do I keep my saves and trophies?
5. can I use the the blue ray player to watch blueray movies and as file storage?
6. what is the life expectancy of the discs? if I want to play a game many times in many years, should I buy it as disc or digital?

What would be better for me to use HDR enabled with YUV422 standard or full RGB for my games? 

With full RGB I get some ugly red/blue lights pop up (expected but still) which doesn’t look that good although colors are more vibrant, I would even say acid-y. With HRD enabled the light contrast is much more pleasant and colors are a bit smoother/dimmer which look more pleasant to my eye but real blacks or whites are not as sharp overall.

I mostly play oldish games although I do have some ps5 compatible titles like borderlands 3 and cyberpunk.

Which option would give me the best quality overall?

P.S.: if I set HDR to auto my ps5 switches it off as default and only enables it in some games."

After talking with customer service for an eternity, they converted my excess discount subscriptions to PS+ into an owed balance and auto-charged me for the “difference.” I lost over a year of paid-ahead PS+ due to their messed up policy and they had the gall to CHARGE me for it.

I am somehow missing the charm those characters and stages should have.

If you don't care for the character i'd rather recommend brawlhalla or wait for multiversus.

I really need help and am really confused. I’ve tried sending the data back to the external hard drive but it keeps saying something went wrong.

I know there is frequently the case where if you want to buy physical version of a game for PS5, you can either buy the PS4 version and get the free upgrade download, or just buy the PS5 disc for a straight install.

What I'm trying to find out, is what games do NOT have a PS5 disc, but have a PS4 disc that allow an upgrade?

The only two I'm aware of are Cyberpunk 2077, and PJ Masks: Heroes of the Night.  Are there any others?

I know it isn't a big deal, just more of a curiosity type thing and a little bit of an awareness thing I guess."

This does not happen when I use the DS4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.

At the very least I wish Sony would let use use the DS4 controller for PS5 games.  We have the option to turn off haptics anyway, so I'm not sure why they're not allowing it other than forcing people to buy more DualSense controllers."

People complain that the story is boring, the villains are awful, it's not as mysterious as the first game, Aloy is annoying, or fat, or both.

Of course there are a lot of people that enjoy the game as well, but it's surprisingly contraversial considering how well recieved and beloved Horizon Zero Dawn was.

I own a PS4 and expect a PS5 to arrive today. I'll sell the PS4, but will keep it around for a while so I can play It Takes Two with my wife (she's not a gamer so we never bought a second controller, this little interval will be our only chance with two controllers).

So, I read online that PS4 controllers can only be used on PS4 games. When I download the game on the new PS5, how do I make sure I'm getting the PS4 version? Should I download it first on the PS4 and tranfer it to the PS5, or can I select it straight from the new console?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the broken english, non-native speaker here.

(P.S.: while not a gamer, we used to play together on x360 for rayman and resident evil games, so my guess is she can handle the new game)"

""Offer ends 9/6/2022""

Literally on the same day that Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest is happening. We know that the update atleast for RE3 has already been found uploaded to the PSN backend, but people are unable to download it as you can see from the link below.

So the update is already up and ready, and the sale ends on Thursday when SGF kicks off. Seems to me like if you are interested in this for the current-gen update, then you have until Thursday to get it for cheap before it launches.

PS5,v5v06a,Major Wifi Issues,"Earlier today I got my ps5. Cleared out my ps4 spot and put my ps5 there. Ever since I first got in the game, I've been having nothing but very bad internet problems. At first I couldn't connect to IP address and then when I could connect to IP address my download speeds were way too slow with download times in the 70s to 80s(hours). Switched back to ps4 and internet works perfectly fine and smooth, but the ps5 struggles hard. 

I've looked at recent posts from last year or so, people talking about the same issues and I tried their solutions to no avail. I don't know what to do because I feel like I just wasted $500. Am I just going to have to get stronger internet or is my ps5 the problem? I kept thinking my WiFi was the problem but it works too good on the ps4 for it to be a WiFi problem so idk. Any help would be appreciated."
PS5,v5uy89,Razer Kaira Pro vs SteelSeries Arctis Pro 7P+ vs Pulse 3D,"Looking for up to date feedback for the above sets.

I have a big head, looking for at least 6 - 8 hours battery life and usually use my headsets primarily when partied up, typically playing some kind of shooter. Play a lot of Siege at the moment.

What are the current thoughts on the above headsets with updated firmware?

Kaira Pro I have read interferes with the controller and I didn't find much regarding battery life.  

Arctis Pro I have read have some audio issues with popping and connectivity.

Pulse 3D is restrictive for people with big heads and the mic is meant to be average/poor."

PS5,v5jr4v,what do you guys think about the PSVR 2?," 

The first VR headset I ever owned was the PSVR, so PSVR was what introduced me to VR. I remember opening the box on Christmas 5 years ago, getting incredibly excited to try 6DoF VR for the first time. Then about 4-6 months later I got bored of VR, due to its shitty tracking solution and shitty controllers. So in 2019 I buy my first ever high-end PC, after saving up for a couple of months, and along with that, I decided to give VR another try, but on a new platform, pcvr. So I bought the Rift S because I didn't have the room size or money for an index, and I had that for about 4 more months before I got tired of it. And now, I'm using a Quest 2, which I love. And after 4 months, I'm still not tired of it. But now, seeing what the PSVR2 will be capable of, I'm getting that. Even if I end up not using my Quest 2. I can just sell that.

What excites me about it are the controllers. they look so much better than the touch controllers. The touch controllers are small and get in the way all the time when loading guns. But what excites me the most about them are the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. If it wasn't for those features, then I wouldn't have decided that I want it, months before it is even released.

Just one thing I'm worried about is the USB-C. Having to run a 4k120 signal through that is going to be tough. I didn't even know that was possible. And I do think the headset looks a bit... ugly. But I'm going to wear it anyways.

So I'm wondering what you guys think? are you going to get it? Or do you not care about it?"

Here are the two different ones that I'm considering:

\[Seagate FireCuba 530\]([https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr\_1\_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr_1_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1))

As you can see both are the lowest prices they have been so far according to camelcamelcamel and both come with heatsinks, one is built in and the other replace the PS5's ssd cover. I don't mind these prices because they are higher tier ssds and great for long term use. I would go with the FireCuba 530 but I don't know if there is a real advantage to replacing the ssd cover with the sabrent heatsink or is the built in heatsink more than enough, or should I mix and match and get the 530 without the heatsink and get the sabrent heatsink for it instead?

It lets me report the issue, then goes through the normal sequence as though nothing had happened...until it crashes again. I haven't dared play any games on it since this started, so thus far, it's done it while watching YouTube or Netflix, or just on the Home screen.

I have power cycled it, checked to make sure my system is up-to-date, switched it from a power strip to its own socket (though with the power strip still plugged in below, in case that could be the issue)...the only thing left to do that I've seen so far is to backup my save files to a flash drive, restart the console in Safe Mode, and ""Reconfigure Console Storage."" If that doesn't work, Sony wants to charge me $229 just to look at it, which is money I don't have.

Has anyone else had this issue? If so, was it ever resolved? And if so, how?

Note: I bought this console from a friend about 2.5 months ago, and although he bought it in September of 2020 (so it's very much out of warranty), he says he only played about 15 hours on it (compared to my 100 or so hours).

PS5,v51cqj,"I've had my PS5 over a week, and I just realized it's the disc edition","I got my PS5 through Sony Direct about a week ago. As soon as I got through the queue, I clicked on ""PlayStation 5 Disc Edition"" and it said sold out, so I immediately bought the only other option, which was just titled ""PlayStation 5 Horizon Forbidden West Bundle"". I assumed since the disc version was sold out, the bundle must be the digital version. 

Today, I was stretching my back on the floor, and looking up from that view, I noticed the disc drive for the first time. I'm pleasantly surprised, but I can't believe I didn't notice it before."
PS5,v516qc,"Looking for a New Display: 28""-32"" for the PS5","I've owned the PS5 for over a month now and I want to upgrade my display. Currently using an old tv mainly to game: 60"" Vizio. Outputs 1080p 60Hz.  

I know that we have a long way to go before gaming at 4K 120Hz on console is possible. I decided to avoid OLED based displays because of the eventual burn in. I have a family member whose phone has an OLED panel and is experiencing burn in after 4 years of use. 

I am looking for a non curved 4K monitor between 28-32"" in size that has the ability to output 120Hz or better. Having VRR thru HDMI 2.1 is a huge plus. Having a KVM switch would be nice but not a deal breaker if not available. If HDR and built in speakers are present, great! If not, again, not a deal breaker. What I am currently deciding between (in no particular order): 

Gigabyte M28U
Gigabyte M32U
Dell G3223Q (not sure why there aren't many reviews out for this one)
Asus TUF VG289Q
Asus TUF VG28UQL1A (although a friend of mine bought one and then returned) 

Any others model reccomendations would be appreciated. I would prefer it to cost under $1,000. Considering I may also need to get speakers/sound bar."

PS5,v50gkg,"PS5 freezes often, anyone know the cause?","So i’ve had a PS5 for about 2 months now and i havent encountered a single error or anything of the sorts until yesterday. 

I was playing the PS5 version of Skyrim and when I tried to save the game the entire PS5 froze and I had to reboot it by pressing the power button for a long period of time.

It worked perfectly fine again so I continued as normal. Fastforward to today where again, after trying to save the game, the PS5 freezes and I have to redo the entire process. It worked fine again but im concerned/curious whether this is a PS5 issue or a Skyrim issue because i havent encountered this problem whilst playing any games.

The only reason I’m happy, or excited about this one is because of the thousands (hopefully more) of mods it will bring to the game!

While I’m a huge fan of ND, Insomniac, and Santa Monica, I’m actually more interested in what else Firesprite is working on.

Now I'm getting the TV remounted lower because it's bad for my neck, and keeping the PS5 in the open is going to be tougher.

I searched for ""USB case fan"" and I see a bunch with USB-A plugs.

PS5,v44pbn,brand new dualsense won't turn on.,"I literally just bought a new dualsense controller, plugged it in and it automatically worked with no issue. I was able to give it the latest update and play for 5 minutes to test it out. 

I turned the ps5 on rest mode leaving the controller plugged in, 40 minutes later it's virtually impossible to get the controller to turn on and give the slightest sign of life. 

I tried :

* Basic reset button : didn't work, won't even make it blink or do anything

* Turning the ps5 off and on with the controller plugged, nothing

* Different usb-c cables or even different power sources, virtually nothing. 

Please anyone, I'm frustrated"

PS5,v42x0r,Brand New DualSense Controllers Have Small Jitters,"I've recently bought a DualSense controller to use with my PC (As a matter of fact I wanted to test the game I developing with DualSense controller). When I saw the games UI does not act as I expected, I checked the controller with different testing tools most notably Steam's and [Gamepad Tester](https://gamepad-tester.com/) website. There I saw very small jitters from both sticks; While those jitters does not have real effect on the general gameplay still I did not expect them; I have tested a couple of other non-PS controllers and they have absolutely no jitters.

For that reason, I have the controller replaced by the retailer. To my surprise the second controller had the same kind of jitters. I've read that DualSense controllers are prone to drifts after sometime but I did not expect them from a brand new one.

Now my question is: Are all DualSense controllers have the same jitters from the beginning or I've just been unlucky with my purchases?"

I haven't been able to play it much due to exams (in fact, I think I've been able to play it 5 times since January). My brother was able to play it for a while last month. My cousin surprised me with it when he sent it over from his place.

1. He forgot to send over the stand. It seems it's important for the air flow. He'll come over next month so should I ask him to bring it with him if he has it at home?

2. I think my Playstation is upside down. I don't think I'll be able to correct it until next month. Will it be fine if I leave it like that?

Thanks."
PS5,v3vijg,The graphical fidelity of RE Village for PS VR2 is the reason why going tethered was the right choice,RE Village reaches the same levels of graphical fidelity on PS VR2 as it does on flat-screens in the latest trailer. This would not be possible without the wire (and without eye-tracked foveated rendering). To make the headset tethered was the right choice and will make high-end VR gaming more accessible and more mainstream. And a lot of people who already had a chance to try PS VR2 said they completely forgot about the wire in an instant.

I can hear a shit ton of different noises coming from my PS5 as it gets stuck on “Calculating”, so for all know, the disc drive is broken. FYI, I have only had this console for about three days. This problem seems to be pretty common, so I hope there’s a definitive fix? Thanks!"

But I wonder if this is the case that ps4 version games are better? Can I play the games on both consoles if the game is released on both? Or will I lose the ps5 upgrade?"

The first game had all these great memorable characters like Bill, Tess, and the two brothers. While Tlou 2 had side characters like Dina, Mel, Jesse, Manny who were rather bland. As for Abby I understand her motives, but still didn't like her as a charachter. The sections with here and Lev were pretty good but felt like a worse version of Joel and Ellie.

PS5,v3b3lc,"Sticky PS5 joystick buttons, almost like glue?","Hi people, about a month ago I stopped playing my PS5 due to health issues / being in hospital. 


I'm back now, and wanted to play Horizon: Forbidden West, and I noticed that my controller's joystick buttons feel sticky, as if the plastic melted / started leaking glue. I remember this from the old N64 controllers after being in a box for years, but I didn't expect this so soon from a PS5 controller. 


Does anyone know how to fix this? Am I going be stuck with them? Do I need to get some sort of button covers for them to continue playing? Due to medical bills I won't be able to afford a replacement just yet..."
PS5,v3b31t,There are no sound from my headphones!,"So basically the story is that I got a ps5 around Christmas 2021 and now in 2022 the sound from my headphones are gone. It first started when I lost the sound on one of my controller's but later it disappeared on both. So now I have no sound from my headphones even though I'm connected.

I know the headphones work and I have tried multiple times with other headphones as well, but nothing works.

Does anyone have an answer to this problem? I have tried everything and I haven't been able to play games with sound anymore."

2: I really can just install any game I had on the PS4 and play it on the ps5? (For example dragon age inquisition, Conan exiles, shadow of the tomb raider)

3: if I use the cables of the PS4 for the PS5 could that damage it?

4: why I'm seeing people buy small usb looking gadgets for the ps5? What's the use of those and should I buy them too?

5: it's better to have the PS5 standing or in an horizontal position?

6: I started far cry 6 on the ps5 but I finished it on the 4, how can I recover the data from the PS4 to the 5?"

Is it safe for me to travel with a new unopened ps5 going through check in luggage. I feel like it might either get stolen/lost or damaged since they throw luggages around with little love and pile them up might crush the console. Any tips on what I should do? If the risk is too high, I would rather just give up on tax refund and bring the unpacked ps5 onboard the plane with my hand luggage. Thanks in advance!"

PS5,v362wn,"If there was one feature i wish the system had, it would be a System-wide Deadzone setting.","I got my PS5 7 months ago with an extra controller, and both of them started to drift after 7 months of use on their left analog stick (its slight but it can get pretty annoying), Some games like Fortnite and COD work just fine because i can set the Dead-zone, other games that i'm currently invested in such as  Metal Gear Solid V don't have a dead-zone, so stealth gets pretty hard since you just randomly start to move, its weird how some games support it, but others don't, i feel like this is a big issue since these controllers are getting pretty notorious for drifting, and once they start drifting, well... you better hope that the game you are playing has a dead-zone setting, cuz otherwise it would start getting pretty annoying, or borderline unplayable at certain points.  


Which is why every PS5 game should have a Dead-zone setting, or better yet, a system-wide Deadzone setting, so devs don't need to bake it into the game, it would give the controllers a longer life-span and  a better reputation, instead having to go buy one for 70$ nearly every 6 months of use."

Nintendo 6-8

Xbox, well they operate more with Gamepass. 

We all know that the money is in the software sales, not hardware sales. 

Why do you think is sony selling so many games? The competition has the same amount of consoles (switch, Wii had even more than the ps3))

Ps4 is the most successful console of all time. With today approximately 1.8,1.9 billion games sold (April 2021 1.6 billion)Why? Wanna know your opinion

Thank you.

PS5,v33luw,GTA V PS Plus: Story Mode version confusion,"I saw GTA Online PS5 version was available for free on PS Plus, so I downloaded it.

To play Story Mode, I need to buy it.

If I buy the Story Mode through this GTA Online installation that I got from PS Plus, will it be the PS4 version, or the new PS5 version?

I can't even find the new Enhanced and Expanded version on the PS store at all, which furthers my confusion.

In my library it does say ""Grand Theft Auto V: PlayStation 5 Edition"" (paraphrasing) but I wanted to confirm before I went ahead with purchasing the Story Mode.

Thank you"
PS5,v33fub,PS5 + Logitech Z906 solution?,"I have a PS5 and a 5.1 DTS Z906 sound system. No hdmi on it, only coax or optical...

But my TV has a hdmi arc port...

Currentlt my PS5 is plugged to the tv and the TV is plugged to the Z906 through optical. With the PS5 sound settings set to Dolby I have true directional 5.1 in games, and DTS working great on blurays, so that is the good news. It also doesn't sound compressed. That being said I am not 100% sure there is no audio channel loss with this setting.

My question is this:

I found a hdmi arc to coaxial converter on amazon. Basically I plan to leave the image transfer untouched via hdmi between the console and the tv, but extract the sound through the arc port of the TV, into the converter, then plugged to the sound system via optical or coaxial...

Does that sound like something that makes sense and would work? The goal is to have pure passthrough sound like the PS4 has when it was plugged directly through optical. Damn Sony why did you remove the optical on the PS5......"

PS5,v2wmsl,Sony-made PS2 emulator - Would you pay for it? How much?,"I was discussing an idea with a group of coworkers the other day and wanted to see what the consensus might be for something specific. In the group of over a dozen people, every single person said they'd be willing to pay for this. And the ones that said they don't own a PS5 yet said they would be willing to buy a PS5 console just to then buy this ""digital console"" on top of it. 

The idea was as follows:

Say that Sony takes their hardware and software source to build a proper PS2 emulator. They achieve 100% game library compatibility and add features like higher resolution rendering, high frame rate support, etc for games.

Obviously this is a big undertaking, so what if Sony said ""Hey, here's a perfect (for the sake of argument) PS2 emulator. We're calling it a 'Digital Playstation 2' and it costs 300 dollars to buy. With that, you can play any PS2 discs you still own via disc. Game developers will support this platform by re-releasing PS2 games for you to buy digitally to play on our new Digital Playstation 2 for discs you don't own or want the convenience of cloud ownership"".

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine any sort of downside to this. With source access, writing the emulators isn't nearly as complex as the guesswork is with open source emulation projects. Plus, it's a huge revenue stream. It shouldn't take that many sales to pay for the labor costs associated with this type of project. With the way things stand today, Sony is just losing a lot of potential income due to PC emulation piracy. Many of those users do it only out of convenience and would be willing to pay to support the devs of the old games they loved in the past.

Not only that, but this would get around any licensing issues with old game re-releases like Microsoft bumped up against with the Series X backcompat project. This project can also be carried forward into future generations; what I mean is maybe on the PS6 or PS7 you pay an ""upgrade fee"" to bring your digital PS2 over to the new console, maybe with even more features at that time. Obviously, this idea could be extrapolated out to all of the old consoles from all manufacturers too."

PS5,v2voy1,"DualSense recognized by Steam, but not Windows...?","Here's a quick recap of the situation, both USB plug in and Bluetooth works with Steam Big Picture and in-game stuff as long as I add the games through steam, and Windows itself also recognizes the DualSense when I plug it in with USB Type C. The problem is however, even though Windows recognizes it when I plug it in, when I connect via BT it simply doesn't recognize that DS is connected. It doesn't recognize any of the inputs I do, nor can I play games without the help of Steam being a middleman. I have tried downloading the latest firmware from official Sony website, the controller is fully charged and the problem only lies in Bluetooth connection, but it's not as if it doesn't work at all with BT, it's just that Windows doesn't get it when it's connected with BT."

PS5,v2tbf7,"Until folders arrive, I wish we could just remove games from home.","It's unfortunate that folders aren't a thing yet, but that's ok I'm quite patient. What bothers me though is that I can't modify the home screen betong keeping what should stay on home. On my Samsung phone I can set it to where new apps go straight to the app drawer and do not appear on my home screen unless I place them there. Implementation of that feature would be very welcome. Every time I download something new it pushes all game tiles off the screen and sometime I forget what was on my home screen.

I'm kind of hoarder with games. I have more titles than I care to admit, although a ton are ps+ titles. Being able to sort my PS4 Pro by genre and also being able to sort each folder in a specific order of my choosing was instrumental in organizing my backlog. I would sort my games by order of interest and the ones I were currently playing would be at the front and as I completed each game I would move them to the back of the list in that folder. If I wanted to do this today, I would need to make the lists by hand and organize those lists on a separate device (laptop/pen and paper). 

When I was young I had a huge interest in gaming. The problem was that my parents weren't well off. When I did get games it was always the previous generation and I only had 3 games max that I would play obsessively. I missed out on the PS3 generation completely and came in at the tail end of the PS4 generation. My first up to date console in my life was a PS4 Pro and my very first game was Horizon Zero Dawn. I had no idea what I was walking in to. Having not played any games for like 8 years, I fell in love. 

Ever since then I wanted to catch up on lost time and hit up all the PS3 remasters and PS4 reboots and sequels. I won't say how many games I have because I'm kind of embarrassed but in the past 3 years I've beaten nearly 70 games. Idk if that's a good thing or a bad thing but either way I've been deeply satisfied, and sometimes frustrated lol during this journey. FOLDERS and being able to organize my backlog was a huge, huge help in me enjoying the numerous games I've played, and I have to say it is sorely missed. 

I'm not sure if anyone else is in the same boat but I would really, really appreciate folders being added to an update soon! I know it isn't a simple task but it would make me super happy. If they could at least let us organize the home screen more that would also be great.

Thanks for the countless hours of entertainment, here's to countless more."

PS5,v2qj0z,A Plague Tale : Innocence is a masterpiece that’s best experienced on PS5,"Lets talk about the game first. The game looks beautiful. It has stunning visuals that will at times make you pause and admire it. The characters in this game feel genuine and you’ll get hooked to each of them. The voice acting is out of this way world. The dialogues and conversations are well written and I personally never skipped a single sentence. The gameplay elements are unique - been playing video games for over 20 years now and this game felt like a breath of fresh air. 

The reason why I urge people to play this on a PS5 is simple - dualsense. This games takes utmost advantage of dualsense’s capabilities. I’ve platinumed Miles Morales and if you think that game has great haptic feedback then wait till you play A Plague Tale. 

I’ve played this games on PC as well but I wanted to give it a shot on PS5 too. I’m so glad I did.

PS5,v2n2el,Where do I buy a PS5,"Hey so my son asked for a PS5 for his 16. Birthday and I have been looking for like the last 2 months but I always sold out within the first 5 minutes or so. Why i wanted to ask, if anyone knew where to get a PS5 until august 1. Btw I’ m in Germany so please nothing from overseas.  
Thanks in advance

PS: Sorry for my bad English it’s not my first language"

PS5,v2litn,It took me so long to find this simple solution to my loud ass disc drive...,"And the answer is a fucking towel!

When i got my ps5 i used it vertically and some games we're obviously way too loud when reading, then one day it got way worse and i changed it to horizontally. It still made a lot of noise but not as before. I also put my ps5 on a wooden cabinet. After some research i learned that its possible that my cabinet isnt stable with the loud noise as a result. For me i became convinced that my ps5 disc drive was maybe broken, so i took it to the store where i bought it. The guy told me to take off the plates and put a cd in it and see if it still makes the same loud noises. I'm glad he told me this cause the noise was reduced and i didn't believe my disc drive was broken no more. I do believe that diffrent games are being read by a diffrent speed cause bloodborne spins the slowest of em all. That game never makes noise when reading. Elden ring comes in second and Dark Souls 3 just makes my ps5 sound like broken jet engine trying to fly away. so I took a towel and placed it under my horizontal ps5 and the disc drive noise was reduced but still not quite as it should sound... I kept it like this for a few weeks until i figured why not fold the towel one more time and it try it like that. Voila, this is all that was needed. Obviously the ps5 disc drive makes some noise when reading, but this was it. This is exactly what its supposed to sound like, and im not sure how to explain it. I think the problem lies with the ps5 plates. People have diffrent places where they put their ps5 but the plates just vibrate and give off this broken sound on a lot of diffrent platforms i believe. Also everyone has their own solution to this, cause the guy who i talked too had the same issue and he resolved it by placing a piece of clay up on his ps5 when its vertically standing, lol. So im wondering if some of you out there had this issue and if so how did you fix it?"

&amp;#x200B;

Well, finally got my hands on a ps5. I still have my ps3 to some nights with friends just to play damm rockband. I guess we got stuck in time but we really like it.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I play these games on the ps5? I can buy new games that's not a problem and I have all the hardware I need (guitar, mic, drums, keyboard).

Is there any guide or past thread that could me guide trought these?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks and happy gaming!"

PS5,v2l51q,PS5 started abruptly shutting down during games,"So as the title says - I recently downloaded Hell Let Loose as part of the PS Plus collection. After about 40 minutes of play, the PS5 randomly just shuts off, and won’t turn back on until I remove the power cord and put it back on. 

I’ve seen others have had this issue; I tried resetting the PS5 from settings, rebuilding the database and clearing system software cache. Still, after about an hour, abrupt shut down.

What’s also weird is that when I put my hand on the console it’s not that hot, and the fan isn’t loud at all. What could this be? Thanks in advance."

PS5,v2k1l0,"If you played through God of War 2018 every time it came out, you will have played through it 6 times in 4 years.","God of war is a great game for sure, but it has entered and exited so many PlayStation services by now that getting it for free has essentially surpassed Skyrim’s re-releases. If you played the game each time it came out on a service, you would have beaten it 6 times as of this summer:

Release in April 2018
Added to PSNow the first time (later removed)
Added to PS Plus Collection
Added to PSNow again
Being added to the new PS Plus Extra tiers
Now revealed as a June 2022 PS Plus Essential title


Again, it’s a great game for sure, but how many times do you need to release the game for free as part of the selling point of a subscription service?"
PS5,v2jvuv,Wait for higher capacity model?,"I am a PlayStation fan but I have not been really fussed about getting a PS5 as I still quite a few PS4 games to play and one big barrier for me was that my TV was a 9 year old 1080p TV and I wanted to experience PS5 on a 4K TV from the beginning.

So, I finally have 4K TV now and now I am debating whether to wait a few more months to see if Sony announce maybe any resign like PS5 slim or maybe a black version (I know they have official covers now) or maybe even a higher capacity model which comes maybe around 2TB native storage.

The chances of a slim version coming out this year highly unlikely and no doubt be snipped by scalpers again and black version is cosmetic (even though I not really a fan of the default white) so a possible higher capacity model by end of year is a possibility and this is what keeping me from actively hunting for PS5 now.

Yes, stocks were still short I had a chance to order in stock disk version last week and didn't do it.

So, what are your guy’s thoughts on a possibility of higher capacity model being released this year and whether it would be better to wait or get a PS5 asap if you can get one in stock at retail price?"

PS5,v1vvoc,"Masterpieces ala Half Life, Portal, Silent Hill, System Shock, Legend of Legaia and many many more need constant updates.","Games are no music or movies. Thanks to gameplay and the fact that they are still young in comparison, the jumps from generation to generations are still high (with slowing down in the future of course…at least when it comes to realism (graphics)). 

Many people not only won’t but can’t play 20y old games. Hell even someone who’s first console was an Atari struggles to replay those Atari classics. 

A new generation of gamer is not the same as a new generation in life. It’s not 30years long. For millions even PS3 titles are already unplayable. They are not conditioned for them. 

The market is good with remasters but that’s not enough. 100s of games need updates. On multiple platforms. That I can’t play Half Life or Legend of Legaia on my Ps5 is ridiculous. Do we really need a Resident evil 4 remake instead of a Dino crisis remake? Count how many times RE4 got a remaster and how many times DC. And how many zombie games exists and how many Dino horror titles. RE4 is already fine. Til ps6. 

Sony also needs to refresh their “for all generations” titles. Thanks to mostly mature games, they are loosing million casual gamers to Nintendo. Instead of making times exclusive deals, use that money for making games ala Sly, Jak and Dexter etc. great again. I don’t care if Xbox gets the game to play or not. For me the lineup is the same.

Problem is, I don't have access to the ps4 version of the game anymore, as I played it through PSNOW back when that was on. Is there any possible way, either through USB shenanigans or some such, that I can get a working save imported to the ps5 version? 

I basically just want to play the DLC's, but I can't stomach playing the entire game again just for that reason tbh."

This setup worked fine as I always used great headphones with 3D audio, but recently I invited some friends and getting the audio for everyone was a problem as you can imagine. 
The question here is, is there any way to go around this problem of extracting the audio to a speaker directly from PS5 or with some extra devices?"

Does anyone know a device, to bundle the HDMI and USB ports so that i can use the USB-C cable for both and i do not need to seperate everything when i want to play?

Im not  accusing anybody. Im just wondering, in your guys opinion, how popular M&amp;K setup on PS5 is these days. How many people are using in multiplayer games. 1%, 10%, more ?

I got PS5 last year running from PC cheaters but then again, I run in to another problem. And that is M&amp;K players. In BF5, lets say, if a guy is using mouse, hes making 90-150 kills with no problem. One guy that I played against 2 rounds, hes making  2.45 kills /min.  Something like 90:4 almost every game, 20% headshot kills etc etc. And hes not using vehicles. Im not saying its not fair, Im not accusing its cheating if PS5 is supporting the mouse out of the box. But Im not shore, do I continue  to play with controller or do I jump on to M&amp;K setup?

If those people are rare, that ok, its not a big deal, but if its more and more popular, do I switch?  


Again, you have to keep in mind how hard is to play against real cheaters on PC and how mentally  devastating is. And I was thinking, console gaming here I come, but then, M&amp;K is now more popular on a console then ever.   


So I don know what to do. I mainly playing MP gamse: BF, R6, Hell Let Loose, PUBG, Sandstorm, etc.  


Thank you."

PS5,v119g1,"One and a half years since PS5 launched, and games still run at 60fps. Are you finally convinced that 60fps is here to stay?","Just a year ago, many people still seemed to be convinced that eventually, at *some mysterious point in the future*, developers will go back to pump their resolution and visual settings to eleven and turn performance back to **30 frames per second** instead. 

Others, at the same time, claimed the increasing trend of ""performance modes"", which prioritize framerate and allow us to play at 60fps or even 120fps, will keep increasing in the future, and the option to choose performance over visual fidelity is here to stay.

We're now 1 1/2 years from launch of the PS5 (and XBox SeX), and I still happily enjoy my PS5 games at wonderfully smooth 60fps.

The way I see it: 30fps is an outdated standard - otherwise developers today wouldn't go out of their way to make their games run at 60 to begin with - and as such, 30fps is finally getting left behind. When HD resolution (1080p) became a thing, developers didn't go back to 480p just to pump their visuals up. 1080p gaming stayed and became the baseline (minus Nintendo), and finally evolved to 1440p, even native 4k. Technology evolves. Resolution evolved. Framerate evolves. This is what we're seeing here. 

The PS5 even has a ""prioritize performance"" mode integrating into its system settings!

**I'm wondering - are people still convinced we will eventually have to go back to 30fps gaming, and if so, why? Were you convinced before but changed your mind in the meantime, and if so, what was the reason? Please feel free to discuss and enjoy.**"

PS5,v0x052,I’m hoping games like Sniper Elite 5 will have either trials on the PS Plus model.,"I have zero interest in buying this game until it’s maybe at like 50% discount. Even then, I would probably be hesitant. 

Die hard fans of the series will always buy it day 1 and that’s great for the devs. 

But for people like me a trail could be a way in. 

So far, I’ve done 2 trails in Cyberpunk and Death Stranding. 

I ended up buying both as I got far enough into the story or game mechanics to get hooked."

PS5,v0tvkh,Nvme Ssd addition?,"Im looking to add another 1tb of ssd internal storage. 
I was set on a firecuda 530 but i find myself asking is it the best out of the bunch. Is it worth the $$$ or is there a cheaper one that performs just as well with a warranty to match?

PS5,v0tao5,PS5 Informational guide. All you need to know about the PS5,"There are two versions of the PS5, the physical/disk version and the Digital version of the PS5, The physical/disk version will be up at the top of the list and the digital version will be closer to the bottom of the list.

The Physical/Disk version of the PS5

Price: 499$ USD or 394 GBP

The Physical version of the PS5 is the more expensive of the two for a good reason, it has a disk drive for the console and is slightly more powerful than the digital and is also the more popular version. The PS5 can back track to the PS4 but it can’t go any further than the PS4, but you can play PS1 and PS2 emulations on the PS5 by buying the game in the PlayStation game store. When you put in a PS4 disk into the PS5 it will show a PS4 icon for the game, and the same for a PS5 game but just with a PS5 icon. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.

The digital version of the PS5

Price: 399$ USD or 315 GBP

The digital version is the cheaper of the two because of the disk drive being non-existent on the digital version, unfortunately because of the disk drive not being there is it worse than the physical version. The PS5 can run PS1 and PS2 emulations by buying them in the PlayStation game store. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.


Buying the PS5

Whether you want the digital version or the physical/disk version the buying will be the same. There are two ways, the in person way or the online way, personally the in person way is much easier, the in person way is simple to do, all you need to do is call your local game store or wherever you want to buy your PS5 and ask when the next PS5 restock is and just come a couple hours early before they open and just wait, that’s the way that I did it although I had to buy it in a bundle and i spent 900$ USD for my PS5, online is more complicated, you basically need to spam click the buy button right at restock in order to have a chance to buy it or you can register your chances at the PlayStation website.

There you are, I hope this helped you out!"

PS5,v0qbhh,External HDD for PS5,"I'm thinking of getting an external HDD (WD My Passport 2TB USB 3.2 Gen 1) to increase the storage on the PS5. I know I can store and play PS4 titles on it. But would I be able to store PS5 titles on it when I'm not playing them, and just move them to the internal SSD when I need to?"

I’m mostly asking those gamers who only play on PS4/5. Do you intend to buy an Xbox for their release? Or are you just accepting that you can no longer play any future Bethesda game because you don’t have an Xbox or PC. You gonna drop thousands and build a PC?

And I picked up spiderman miles morales and ratchet and clank with the gift card and plan on using the last $20ish to go to a charging dock for the controllers. What are some essentials I should look into buying like games/ accessories and any other items that can enhance to experience"

PS5,v0p800,Gran Turismo 7 or Grid Legends?,"Can I get an unbiased opinion? Trying to decide between GT7 or Grid Legends for the PS5. Honestly, I’ve been holding out on getting GT7 for so long because it looked so boring, but then I came across Grid Legends and it’s slightly more arcade-like gameplay, and it looks fun. But I’m inclined to just go with the name brand title. Anybody played both and can give some insight?"
PS5,v0p2y5,What titles were you hoping for in ps plus premium that didn't happen?,For me it was The Legend of Dragoon and Parapa the rappa.  I would have insta upgraded but so far nothing shows those 2 on there.
PS5,v0oycn,PoE 2 Deadfire: Anyone played this on the PS5?,I keep hearing that the load times for this game made it unplayable on the PS4. Has anyone in this community played this on the PS5 and can vouch for it? I really want to dig into an old school crpg like this but if the performance issues haven't been fixed then I don't want to waste my money. Thanks in advance!
PS5,v0oh7x,wondering peoples opinion on far cry 6,I played far cry 5 and new dawn a little under a year ago and thought they were awesome games (5 was way better but new dawn was still good) I'm getting far cry 6 at the end of the month and was wondering what everyone thought about it. so far all I know is what was shown in the trailers so please do not spoil it for me. I have been wanting it for a while and seeing that the gold edition is 53 bucks makes it feel like the perfect time to buy
PS5,v0o9g4,Spiderman remastered,"So i have spider man 1 on ps4. I want to buy miles morales on ps5 now and i saw that the ultimate edition features spiderman 1 remastered. Is there a difference between spiderman remastered and spiderman with the ps4 disc, but played on a ps5? Because i heard that many ps4 games like god of war or horizon got a patch, that makes the ps4 versions much better on ps5 (kinda like a remaster)"
PS5,v0o6d0,Is it possible to connect a dual sense controller to a PS5 via a usb Bluetooth receiver?,"I want to play my PS5 from multiple rooms in my house. 

I have an HDMI switch, usb switch, and in wall optical fiber that will run usb and hdmi to each room.

The only problem is I don’t want to be tethered to the usb cable.

Is there a way to connect a Bluetooth receiver to the usb cable, then pair the controller to the Bluetooth receiver and have the controller inputs be translated into the proper usb signal the PS5 would expect as if the controller was connected directly through Bluetooth?"
PS5,v0nm8z,Demon's Souls- Amazing Game,"Demon's Souls came with my PS5 bundle and I gave it a few tries but ended up rage quitting each time. I'm new to Souls games and it seemed ""too hard"". After over a year of not attempting DS again, Elden Ring became all the hype. I refused to buy Elden Ring out of fear that I wouldn't stand a chance because I couldn't even play DS. So I set out and tried the game again and again (and again). After finally getting past 1-1, getting better gear, learning hit boxes and watching hella YouTube videos, I finally beat the game. The graphics of this game alone are insane and if there's anyone else out there that wanted to give it another try- I highly encourage you to try again. It's definitely one of the hardest games I've ever played (right there with Ninja Gaiden) but I'm glad I was able to get through it!!"
PS5,v0mra5,"“Gone Home“ is one of those games, which will create goosebumps on my body, even when I’m 80y old. This game just blew me away. I can’t recommend it enough. The story and presentation is absolute mind blowing.",Some games are so melancholic and let you rethink your life…

PS5,v0liao,Ps4 usb hard drive transfer to ps5 requires reinstallation of certain games?,"I just got a ps5 and transferred my ps4s usb hard drive to it and I’ve been playing games great. But when I launch COD MW 2019 it says “cannot launch game or app.” Is this because it says “ps4” when I hover over it in the game library? Do I need to reinstall it so it’s a ps5 version?

Also in case it’s important, when I load up Cold War to go to MW from the menu it says “full modern warfare installation required” but when I go to manage game content it says everything is installed but only some of the Cold War stuff says “usable” instead of “installed” like the MW add ons."
PS5,v0l3iq,"SHIB Days of Play Sale (Tiny Tina’s, Cyberpunk, Sifu)","
The only game that isn’t on sale is SIFU but it’s still around the same price as both games, actually in the middle. I enjoyed borderlands 1 and 2 but three didn’t really hold me I found it boring and repetitive. However, I like the different setting of this game and want a game to sink some hours into. I’ve had my eye on aifu but I also know it’s the least amount of content. Lastly, I’ve played cyberpunk when it first came out but refunded it once I rushed through the main story, I enjoyed it but wanted my full 60 dollars back. I know it’s got a PS5 update and an expansion is coming in 2023"

PS5,v0ge1x,"So I posted earlier about wishing I had got a 4TB SSD, as opposed to a 2TB, so I’m going to clarify why I needed 4, and clear up some assumptions.","Firstly, yes I easily filled up my 2TB drive the day I got it with solely PS5 games. As currently my owned PS5 games totals 192.

Yes I am aware I could just delete, or install them within a few minutes, but this is dependent on my location. My job however takes me to a lot of very remote locations throughout the world, for weeks, or months at a time, and I rarely even have access to basic internet capabilities.

So being able to install a plethora of games is extremely important, because not only do some days consist of sitting around doing very little; but also I have colleagues who also play on the console, who like different games.

So yes, I could delete a game and download a new one while at home, or somewhere with the ability to get online. But it’s not always an option. 

My last research trip alone, I spent 86 days straight disconnected from the outside world, aside from scheduled times where I had access to a satellite"

Suggestions?"
PS5,v0fdcy,"How long do you guys think the PS4 will last?, why cross-gen games ?","After Sony's new report we can see that the PS4 playerbase is still incredibly active and that a good part of Playstation Plus subscribers and Playstation Store buyers came from PS4 and not PS5, looking at it this way you can understand why that Sony has changed its strategy and made new games like God of War: Ragnarok a cross-gen game.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people are dying to see ''only-next gen'' games as soon as possible, but honestly... as long as Sony doesn't fix the PS5's out-of-stock problem once and for all I'm not upset of the same trying to keep the PS4 for a while longer, what's the point of making exclusives for the PS5 if a lot of people won't be able to play after all?, in the end this would only negatively affect sales.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hope that by 2023 this problem is solved and the PS5 becomes more accessible, until then, I don't see anything wrong with giving people the option to continue playing on PS4."

Tried performance mode on Mass Effect Andromeda and there were still steep frame rate drops all the time. On the other hand, Elden Ring and COD run at 60fps locked even on resolution mode. 

I've heard turning on VRR can help boost framerates but I'm not sure if that also has any pros and cons.

I definitely prefer 60fps locked. I don't care that much about resolution or graphics as long as the game doesn't look like utter dogshit. Kingdom Come Deliverance looks pretty bad on the PS5 though."

Because I want to transfer my games from PS4 to PS5, that would require both of them to be on at the same time, and Im worried that if I dont have an adapter to accommodate both consoles at once, then I'll have to sit without any PS5 games while I wait for the chance to buy an adapter.

A specific model name or a link to an image of the electrical plug will be greatly appreciated.

(as a bonus question: do I have to buy Persona 5: Royal/The Witcher 3 Complete Edition again so I can play it on PS5?)"

PS5,v04vu8,bro how is it this unstable?,"My PS5 which i got last year on Christmas is very unstable to the point that spiderman miles morales crashes before it even finishes loading and this is the most recent and extreme case ive had and i only started using it for about a week it doesn't make sense yes i got it  on Christmas but i haven't started using it until now and now that im using it it's mind bogglingly unstable any game may it be ones from my ps4 that ran perfectly fine on it, now have a large chance of crashing for no reason im getting really upset over it now 
The one and only game that hasn't crashed or has crashed the least is dmc5 special edition and it cant be because the data is corrupted i just set the thing up unless it somehow corrupted DURING THE CONSOLE SETUP  i dont understand how it could be this bad yeah my ps4 crashed a few times but it was only for a couple games and it was specific reasons god of war 2018 was kinda buggy on my ps4 and crashed SOMETIMES same with fallout 4 but  fallout 4 was a good but very very janky mess of a game at times even before i started using mods on it 
And i think the first spider man was a little buggy and would crash too but it was nowhere near as bad as its successor 
I cant open a game without having to hold my breath in anticipation for it to crash  now cause almost no game is safe 
EVEN ASTRO'S PLAYROOM A GAME BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM ISNT SAFE  on memory meadow it crashes WITH OUT FAIL 
Most of the time immediately sometimes i can get some work done in the level but mostly just as soon as i drop into the level astro cant even reach the ground before it crashes 
Like seriously i dont know what to do anymore other than just to deal with it and i keep sending the error reports in hopes that they will see and fix the problem but IF ONLY I WERE THAT LUCKY i cant help but ramble on and on over it but just to tell you my story of warning and misfortune be happy you arent me cause my tech never wants to work with me this wasnt really me trying to get help for the problem it was just to let it be known and not be an experience just for me to suffer in"

PS5,v01orl,Guide: Hacking discord to work with PS5,"Hi everyone, of course it's very stupid and annoying to try to play PS5 with your discord friends on PC. Here's what you need for a workaround:

1. headphone splitter cable. I'd try to get them from a local electronics store rather than something online

2. headphones that have a removable cable, that can be connected with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable.

3. a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable. In fact, two of them.

4. a device that can run discord and has a microphone. I used my laptop.

Put it all together. Connect the jack of the headphone splitter to your headphones. From the two ports on the headphone splitter, use the two cables and connect your discord device and PS5. The headphone splitter I'm using just automatically combines the audio from both sources into the headphones. My friends can hear what I'm saying because the laptop picks it up just fine. You just have to tweak the audio on both console and device to make sure it's right.

Hope this helps someone! I was so excited when I got it to work."

PS5,uzqr7m,Some PSVR games already have upgrade/next-gen patch on PS5 even with old PSVR.,"This is something I don't see a lot of people commenting on, but some games already have massive improvement when played on PS5 even though it's a PS4 app, sure... it's still limited by the resolution of the original PSVR, but I think when PSVR 2 arrives it will probably be backwards compatible with the original PSVR games so it's really nice to know that some games already run better when played on the PS5 even with the original PSVR.

&amp;#x200B;

Of the two games I know are:

&amp;#x200B;

Zenith: The Last City :

When played on PS4 or PS4 Pro the game has very large loadings times on some areas, on the PS5 these loadings times do not exist, in addition the resolution is better, texture quality is slightly better and the draw-distance is much greater.

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw)

&amp;#x200B;

No Man's Sky VR :

The PS4 version is a blurry mess, on PS5 not only the resolution is much better but also the texture quality, shadow quality, foliage and etc... is much higher.

[https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE](https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE)

&amp;#x200B;

There are other games like Star Wars Squadrons, Hubris VR and Swordsman VR that apparently also have significant improvements when played on PS5 even with the original PSVR, but I can't confirm about this game, I wonder if more other games like Resident Evil 7 will get it. upgrade to PS5 in the future."

I know this is a question that is often asked esp. on this sub so my apologies but there’s been a lot of developments as of late so I feel like this time around that classic question of Xbox X vs ps5 is different. 


For the longest time, I told myself I'm getting a Xbox series X mainly because of Gamepass and how awesome it is. Even when Sony announced their new competitor. But now, I'm really torn. On the one hand, gamepass is still awesome. Especially with the Blizzard-Activision acquisition which could bring COD to gamepass which is major news for me because now I don't have to shell out 60 dollars every year. But at the same time Sonys competitor is seriously starting to look good. Just today, they announced some Ubisoft classic games (certain curated games) are coming to the Extra bundle of The new ps plus (article: Ubisoft classic). I also really am a fan of the new Sony controller. If anyone has been keeping up with all the recent news I would really appreciate some advice.

PS5,uzqeyr,"PS5 emulators should be made to work with ps3 , ps2 , psx discs.","A bit of context here. I've always been a PlayStation guy , not because I'm a fanboy or anything , its just Xbox is really unpopular where i live and back in the day there weren't many OG xbox's and 360's. So i bought the ps2 , psp , ps3 , ps4 and now ps5. Also I don't like digital games , I like physical copies and if i get a chance to buy a physical copy i usually go for it . That's also mostly because internet back in the ps2 , ps3 cycle , in my country wasn't good. So i have all these ps2 games , ps3 games that are just lying there .  
A CD if preserved can last up to 200 years , most ps3's break down after like 12-15 years of normal use.   
So all those CD's which are memories, mementoes from past which i paid for at that time are just paperweights and will be paperweights after my ps3 eventually breaks down. i was so happy when i learnt that ps5 will have ps4 disc's backwards compatibility. I mean sure the new PS Plus subscription is fine and dandy and allows you to play classic ps games but i don't want to pay 120 dollars a year to play games that i already own. On the other hand Xbox has done such a good job with backwards compatibility everything starting from the OG xbox to xbox one is backwards compatible (sure there are some games that you cant play) and you don't have to pay a subscription to pay the games if you already own its physical copy , just put it in and voila.  We all know a ps5 can do ps3 emulation , its plenty powerful . Why does Sony ignore the ps3 like this . It really pisses me off lol."

I’m probably bored on my phone, when I come up with the idea to hop on Call of Duty. I grab my SteelSeries 3 (specifically console edition) and I go ahead and check it’s unmuted before I plug it into the controller because I had heard that fixes the following problem I’m about to have that I’ve had in the past.

The audio output settings are perfect, but it’s the microphone settings that are really messed up… apparently the PS5 or whatever is supposed to recognize that I have a headset plugged in is messed up (even after plugging being unmuted). In the microphone settings, it says “Input Device”, and next to it says, “Microphone on Controller”.

“Uh-oh!“ As my bad memories flood and invade my mind reminding me that this problem will never be fixed. 

I press the little “Input Device” thing (while my headphones are plugged of course) and the “Microphone on Controller thing is the only option.

I also know that it isn’t my headphones because when I pressed on the “Adjust Microphone Level” thing and I lightly tapped my headset mic and controller, and I could safely say that it was indeed my controller.

What a mischievous little controller I have… he’s probably jealous of the headset, loser.

Here’s what I haven’t yet tried:

-Smashing the controller against the ground
-Returning the headset

I literally need help immediately, and yes, everything is plugged in correctly and nothing is loose. Please, help and don’t let the controller win this war…"

I got gran turismo 7 over a week ago and I don't play my ps5 everyday due to work and stuff so it's mainly a weekend thing. So yeah I started playing gran turismo 7 and loving it! But thought I want to go back to another game I need to finish. Dying Light 2 to be exact and Lord behold it can't read the disc, Comes up with the error unreadable disc. So I tried a few other discs like last of us part 2 and other ps4 and none would read. But as soon as I put gran turismo 7 back in it reads it fine? 
After that I booted into safe mode and did a clear system software cache and rebuild the database which worked. It read all the other games fine. I even played dying light 2 for abit. After that I thought I'd try gran turismo again and yep you guessed it..  won't read any other discs bar that one.. Great... so did what I did before rebuild the database etc. But this time it didn't work. Fab... so went back to safe mode and checked if there was an update im missing just incase i didn't get a notification for it. And there was so the ps5 updated and it reads discs again but I'm scared to put gran turismo back in incase it messes the ps5 up 😅

At this point in the last gen, we had games like: the order, batman and ac unity, All of which look incredible till this day and are true next gen only games. 

But we are yet to see anything like that (especially when it comes to the characters).

Do you have any game or a trailer suggestion that would show off next gen models?"

PS5,uzhuhu,My Playstation 5 is showing picture glitches in PS Plus menu!,"Hi everyone!

Hope all of you are doing fine, I am new to the community and I recently had the privilege of buying myself a brand new PS5. It is barely 10 days old, I have set it up and was enjoying it on tcl c728 QLED tv. Everything was fine until today when I started to observe very irritating glitches in the PS Plus menu. So, the thing is where the whole PS plus library is listed, this one game (Days Gone) image is all weird and by weird I mean a glitch. Every other title is fine (appearance wise, it is as it should be).

Now hovering down there is another glitch on one of the blocks of Ps Plus menu and text appears shadowy and there are pixels everywhere. Apart from that everything is fine, the games, other menu items, the setting, all is solid except the Ps Plus menu. **(For some reason I can't attach any screenshots here)**

**Following are the things that I have tried;**

**-Restarting the PS5**

**-Shutting it down and powering it back on**

**-Changing from ethernet to Wi-Fi and from Wi-Fi back to the ethernet**

Nothing seems to fix it and it is driving me crazy, it is a completely brand new device, the PS5 itself and the TV. Can't pinpoint what the issue might be. If anyone can help me I shall be very thankful. I wasn't able to find anything regarding this issue not on Google, YouTube or even Reddit. Seems like a special case.

Plz help!

P.S. It appears that for some reason Days Gone logo is being replaced with a sack boy block that is below the games. Please any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks"

PS5,uzg8ss,My 1 year review,I've had my PS5 for about 16 months now and here's my experience. First off I'd like to say the main reason I was dying for a PS5 was that crispy demons souls remake. And man did it live up to its expectations. If it wasn't for demons souls remake being a PS5 exclusive I probably still wouldn't have one. When I first got my PS5 and played Astros playroom I was all smiles. So this is what next gen will feel like. I was so excited. But then none of the games besides returnal used those features. The console is still too new and I understand that. But even a game like demons souls which was a PS5 exclusive didn't use or even have a option to use those features. It's a perfect console and I can't wait to see what games feel like in a few years when they all use the haptics / adaptive triggers.

PS5,uzattj,Dualsense vibration becomes rattling after prolonged playing,"Basically what title says: I have a PS5 for couple of months, and recently I noticed, while playing God of War, that after like 30 minutes of playing, the vibration of the Dualsense controller becomes much louder, kinda like rattling or rumbling, as if there was something loose inside the controller.

When I shake the controller manually, I hear nothing. When I wait for couple of minutes, and continue playing, it is still there. First I thought it's intentional loud vibration from the game. But when I turn off the controller, just for a couple of seconds, and turn it on again, it goes away. The vibrations become soft purrs again. And it returns again after 15 minutes of playing or so.

Anyone experiencing anything similar? It doesn't seem like a hardware issue, as it goes away with just turning off and on again. I have to check if it happens with other games too, but I believe it does. It doesn't affect gameplay, it's just a bit unsettling. Not sure if I can even claim a warranty for this. Any opinions/experience welcome."
PS5,uzah2j,PS5 Console Covers Restock?,"Hi r/PS5!

I was wondering if anyone here has any idea when the PS5 Console Covers tend to restock on PlayStation Direct.

I recently found a steal of a deal on eBay for the DualSense Wireless Controller - Midnight Black and really want the PS5 Console Covers - Midnight Black but they’re always out of stock when I check.

PS5,uza1nl,Mute and unmute buttons are the best editions to the new System in terms of Quality of Life,"I use it, more than I could’ve ever imagined myself using one singular function on a console.

It’s just so useful, being able to mute myself, mute the entire console, and then unmute each one individually. 


Honestly the little things matter so much, I use this function every single day and I love it thank you Sony lol."

Am I in the wrong? Have the ""older"" dualsense that are newer than the original dualsense been improved than the original white? Has Sony changed the cosmic red and black dualsense after they've started to sell the newer three colors? Should I stay with the cosmic red or get a refund and buy another one?

I feel like their imaginations are limited or that they were trained without knowing it to have low expectations.

I can’t wait until world building is not dictated by forced walking sections, crawl sections, squeeze sections, and elevator sections, and land layout dictated by hiding loading screens.

I can’t wait until we can see some actual improvements to all animation and physics systems along with improvements to AI.

It connects to my TV, so I can change the volume and turn off the TV, however it doesn’t let me use the PS5 at all. Only when I reset the system does the remote work again. Sometimes when I turn it on from rest mode it would show it’s connected to a mouse &amp; keyboard and it won’t let me use the media remote until I fully turn off the console and turn it back on. Is anyone else experiencing this?"

Sure, I can buy one for a hugely inflated price on EBAY or Craiglist or something, but WHY can't I after all this time not as a regular Joe-consumer go to Best Buy or Walmart, or wherever and get one????????? There is something wrong with Sony saying their sales of PS5 are going through the roof when people like me cannot get one yet!!! Hello???? Please help me out with this!!!"

PS5,uyedd6,Porting games to PC,"Sony recently released sales numbers on a few games they've ported to PC.

Horizon Zero Dawn:
Copies Sold- 2.39 million
Revenue- 60 million

Days Gone:
Copies Sold- 852k
Revenue- 22.7 million

God of War:
Copies sold- 971k
Revenue- 26.2 million

Based on these numbers I can definitely see why Sony waits so long to port over their games. GOW selling &gt;1 million copies, in about half a year makes me think two things. 1. PC gamers pirated that game alot. 2. PC gamers are not as enthusiastic about PS games as some believed. I know the game has only been out for about 5 months but a game that big and beloved should have sold more I feel. Especially given the fact that it's release was alot better than HZD's. 

I don't have a problem with PC releases but if this is what Sony gets then Day 1 is certainly out of the question for probably every first party release. Anyone with their hopes up for a Bloodborne PC port these numbers don't look good for that. I'd put my money on a 60 fps update.

Let me know if you agree or came to different conclusions based on the figures they released. I've seen some ""discussion"" online (Twitter) but I felt like this is the better space for that."

But over time I started taking the odd screenshot here and there, but lately I've really gotten into the Photo mode on some of my PS5 games. 

My question is, what to do with them? I want to stick them on social media somewhere. I was thinking probably Instagram? But I wanted to see if there's anywhere else people might recommend instead, where people are more inclined to be looking for these kinds of things.

Any suggestions welcome!"
PS5,uyctny,PS5 glitch/freeze/Idk ?,"So, today I had just closed ‘Tomb Raider’ on My ps5, when I quickly went into one of my friends profiles. While scrolling through his games, the list stopped updating/loading. I hit ‘O’ to go all the way back to the Home Screen, and when I tried to get back to my profile using the quick access bar, it would not go through.

My PS5 didn’t necessarily freeze as I could still navigate around the menu, but nothing was loading (psstore, psplus, nothing), and whenever I selected a prompt like going to settings or, even turning it off, nothing happened. Even when I hovered over the game, there were no stats of your trophies in the corner, or even a ‘Play game’ button. Also noticed that my online status had be greyed out.

I tried to log out, which it actually did, but didn’t show me the actual profiles page, just the background graphic, of the light shining through the grey.

Eventually I had to take it off by the plug, because it wasn’t letting me manually turn off (in retrospect, I just learnt that it takes 20 secs of holding down the button to hard reset, which I didn’t hold for that long, so that’s on me). All seems to be fine now.

Anyone have any idea what happened, and if I need to worry? Thanks in advance"
PS5,uycmw6,New Witcher Game Currently in Pre-Production With 100+ Devs; Cyberpunk 2077 Next-Gen Update Boosted Sales, 
PS5,uycd7n,So... about cross-gen games.,"Honestly I don't blame Sony for revising their strategy and making future releases like God of War: Ragnarok become cross-gen games.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people want to see ''only-next-gen'' games but what's the point if this is going to significantly affect the game's sales since a lot of people can't even find a PS5 to buy yet?

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the new Horizon is the most beautiful game I've seen on PS5 so far and it's a cross-gen game that came out for PS4 too, if the next cross-gen releases don't affect the quality of the next-gen versions then I'm more than satisfied, people need to play this game, if ps4 is the only option for them to play then great, i don't think it's bad to keep cross-gen games for another year, at least until this out of stock issue and scalpers is finally resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, what doesn't make sense is to want only-next-gen games while this problem is not solved once and for all, this is even a little selfish if you stop to think about it."

I moved from Aus to UK and brought my PS5 with me. I know a lot about the region difficulties with PSN etc. but I just wanted to ask for a hypothetical scenario. Let's say Horizon Forbidden West came out with DLC. I have bought a physical copy of that game in the UK not Australia (which is where my PSN is situated). If DLC were to hypothetically come out for it, would it be possible for me to buy that DLC for my UK copy of Horizon and for it to work?

I know I can't buy DLC from a different PSN storefront, but as far as I understand, for DLC to work it just needs to match the product/region code of the game, as far as I am aware the UK and Aus have the same region as they both have PPSA on the sides of their game covers and they are both in R2? So in theory the DLC should work? Thanks in advance!"

 I'm trying to find something interesting to play and I would love to personally get into a multiplayer game but there seems to be none out that really peak my interest. I have Vanguard but dropped it And I was told to avoid 2042 at all cost.

Right now the next game that really has my interest is going back to godfall with the ultimate edition being on sale. I enjoyed while I just never really had the time to play a lot of it.

I was planning on upgrading to the premium pricing tier, but I'm reading that it will prorate and charge you for the remainder of your subscription based on the new price?

If so, seems like it doesn't make sense to use the card and add another year on top of my existing subscription."

Been playing Metal Gear Solid 4 and other PS3 titles on the pc lately and was wondering what the chances are of MGS4 coming to the new subscription service? It kind of sucks it will be via cloud gaming so i'm hoping they'll be able to emulate PS3 games on the PS5 somewhere down the line.   
I don't know why but i find most PS exclusives these days pretty stale and boring (they all feel the same with a different setting to me) and am having much more fun playing the PS3 titles. Maybe i'm just getting old xD   
Is there also any chance there will be new MGS games in the future? Whether they are remakes or completely new ones :)

I finally decided to pick the PS5 over the Xbox (which might be stupid, as you get one and can't lay hand on the other), mainly for Hogwarts Legacy (my Computer ain't working Three Kingdoms anymore, so it was that or a new computer for six times the price to play the exact same games), and I've really grown confused with all that Drops as of now.
But since I don't technically need it before Legacy comes out around September/October, I'm not really sure which guide to believe, as they all say something different. Many people seem to say that one should pick the first offer you can grab, as production will expectedly take a huge blow over the summer (or so they say), while others say to patiently wait until price drops to what its supposed to be.
I'm not really sure, so I'm gonna ask her - I don't really wanna pay an extra 200 for buying it right now, but it seems to be completely impossible to grab hold of one for the regular price now. Should I grab it immediately when there is one I can get or wait for the perfect offer?"

PS5,ux5y5c,"Can we stop with the fake ""alpha/beta"" titles and properly call them stress tests?","It is just so obsurd to think that a developer would give alpha/beta access to console players on AAA titles.    On PC some small indie devs, sure they may do that if want to spread the word but definitely not to thousands.     Maybe a few dozen.  

Why is this done?   Because publishers think it makes players feel *special"" and I guess gives bragging rights.  (I been playing since the beta).    Idk I guess kids care about that crap.    These beta/alpha ""tests"" are actually what the gaming industry considers as ""stress tests"" .        I have seen a few times where devs will say it's a stress test before launch but majority of the time it's alpha/beta. 

When a game is development during the alpha stages most textures/animations are not even finalized and the only people who could even get a sneak peek were game journalists but were under heavy NDAs.   The real NDAs where at the very least you were kicked out of the gaming industry if not facing jail time and heavy fines to ruin your life. 

I don't know why I let it bother me so much I guess it's always been a pet peeve of mine.     When a game has already gone gold and they are still doing a ""beta"" test it just annoys me when someone finds a genuine complaint only to be met with ""Its just the beta it will be fixed at launch"".  Ugh no that's not...... Nevermind"

PS5,ux3xw3,I cannot believe how much fun Multiversus is.,"About 20-25 hours in so far playing the closed Alpha and it’s so much fun. This is a full blown live service “Smash” experience, albeit in its own take of course.

There’s so much to do, *so much to earn*, ranked mode, battle passes, custom lobbies, every single character has their voice actors returning to voice them, etc etc etc. The fighting feels so satisfying too! 

You get like 300 coins when winning a match, and each character costs 2,000 coins to unlock so its rather fast (could very well change for launch but it should be similar). They’re going to make their money mainly with skins and to get characters faster, and *man* are they leaning into the fan service!

One of my favorite shows of all time is Adventure Time, the closed Alpha has a free battlepass that goes to level 50 and one and of the skins is an alternate version of Jake, Cake, from [Fiona and Cake](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZrUbFfztHvXE4P5i9)! And you guessed it, they brought the VA who voices Cake to voice the lines as well! This is just one example of many. They could have easily done something super simple like Jake in a number of outfits, so I was shocked they’re already doing stuff like this, the fan-service is going to be **real** haha.

The biggest indicator for me was a few of my friends who are HUGE into Smash, they still play every single week, go to tournaments, hang out at weekly Smash events, and ever since they started playing the Alpha they *have not stopped playing it*, they’re loving it! So excited for open beta when everyone can play.

I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I genuinely think this will be up there with Smash."

PS5,ux0lmh,Best method to split HDMI 2.1 cable to 2.1 Video with toslink optical audio out to Dolby Digital DTS amp,"Finally managed to get hold of a PS5 only to discover they've ditched the onboard toslink connector! 

My TV is a Samsung QE55Q70R - not 2.1 (2.0b?) but does do stuff at 120Hz + freesync etc

From what I'm reading, people are suggesting using the optical audio out on the TV. However, I'm worried about 2 things. Firstly latency (as the trip will be longer than from the PS5 straight to the amp) and also I'm not sure if my TV can support it (just tested with my PS4 setup - this is using a hdmi 2.0 cable though - however - can't select Dolby Digital as the audio out when the PS4 is running on it).

I'm thinking the best solution would be to bring the 2.1 HDMI out for the ps5 into one of those splitter boxes, which outputs hdmi video out and also provides a toslink output, which can then go straight to my amp. However, I'm worried about whether these boxes effecting both the audio and video quality. 

Firstly, would this be an OK approach and secondly are there any recommended brands of the splitter boxes?

I've tried to get my head around ""Arc"" - but baffles me a bit - just need an optical out carrying DTS 5.1."

PS5,uwzxwp,NAT Type Keeps Switching,"So me and my roommate are both trying to play a game together, one of us on PS4, and the other on PS5. We are both connected to the same router, both LAN cables. The current issue we are dealing with is that the NAT type is blocking us from playing with one another.

When we both started off unable to play cross-console, we were both NAT type 3, and aimed to fix it. But whenever we follow whatever is recommended online to fix NAT type issues, one of us goes to NAT type 2 as planned, while the other stays in 3. Then, we follow another method, and the Type 2 gets switched over to the other console, and the other has Type 3. This problem has persisted for the past two days now, and despite constant efforts to be able to play with each other, no posts online have seemed to work, which is very disheartening, since I gave my roommate a PS4 so that we had things in common for us to play.

Thank you to anyone who reaches out to help, or takes the time to read this, any sort of help is appreciated."

PS5,uwqrtz,This needs to be spread out. PlayStation is making users to pay back the discount they got when upgrading membership.,"It was exciting when I found out the new PlayStation Plus service tiers have arrived, but my joy was gone within seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's how much Sony charges for all three tiers of membership in Hong Kong:**

**Essential: HKD 308**

**Extra: HKD 515**

**Deluxe: HKD 599**

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 years and 19 days left.

I bought my 4 years of membership for the price of HKD 231/205/205/205, when it was discounted last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**At first, I thought I only have to pay for the differences between Essential and Deluxe, which should be:**

**(599-308) x 3=873**

**And 19 days should be:**

**(599-308) ÷ 365 x 19=15.15**

**Total should be:**

**873+15.15=HKD 888.15**

&amp;#x200B;

**But Sony decides I have to pay back the discount I got last year.**

**Here's the calculation:**

**(599-205)=394 x 3=1182**

**(599-231) ÷ 365 x 19=19.16**

**Total: 1182+19.16=1201.16**

&amp;#x200B;

**Almost identical to the price Sony is asking on the upgrade page.**

&amp;#x200B;

I understand it might cost a lot for Sony to launch the service, but seriously, taking back the discounts I've gotten already? That's low.

It seems that if you plan to upgrade with your current subscription then it will charge you a price in accordance to  how many remaining days you have left in your account. 

The question though is what if you already subscribed for more than 1 year and you decided to upgrade? 

Let’s say you have a PS plus subscription for 2 years and you decided to upgrade to the next tier? Would it charge you for the whole 2 years immediately? I’m not really sure because there is no option on how long do you plan to have that subscription.

So for those who plan to stack their PS plus please be careful."

PS5,uwhep4,I'm so disappointed in the new PS plus,"I am a PlayStation player of Hong Kong. This morning, I excitedly opened PS5 and prepared to upgrade my PS plus to extra to download new games. But in the upgrade interface, I vaguely felt that there was an upgrade price problem. I'll explain that in more details.

1. There is only one option for you to upgrade your PS plus. Upgrade all remaining days or not upgrade. And if you purchased PS Plus with a discount before, you need to pay SONY back all the money of the previous discount when upgrading.

2. When new PS plus published, SONY announced that there would be more than 400 games in PS plus extra. In fact, there are only 247 games in the library. And if a game has ps4 and PS5 versions, it counts as two games. In summary, the actually number of games should be no more than 200. And there are some PS4 games that I think are in tier 2 libraries that actually need tier 3 to play.

I bought a one-year PS Plus membership at a discount of 205HK before. The cost of my upgrade is 222.51HK. According to my expectation, I need to pay 148HK for the upgrading:(515-308)\*261/365=148HK

But I actually need a lot more than that, so I do the math

(515-205)\*((261+1)/365)=222.52

So, upgrade cost = (original price - the price you actually paid) \* ((remaining days +1) /365)

It means that no matter how long you bought it at the discount price, SONY now requires you to pay the full price if you want to upgrade your PS plus, and you have to upgrade the remaining days all at once.

All in all, the new PS plus are not as good as I expected. and one more question, why pictures are not allowed in raddit?"

Here we do a simple maths problem.

The original PS Plus in HK is 308HKD/year, and the PS Deluxe in HK is 599HKD/year

The difference should be 599-308=291HKD/year.  This is equal to 0.797HKD/day. That means my upgrade fee for 88 days should be 70HKD.

However, the fact is my upgrade fee for 88 days is 107.28 HKD = 1.219 HKD/day.

599-154=445HKD/year. This is equal to 1.219HKD/day.

Definitely, SIE is one of the greediest publishers I‘ve ever seen.

The thing is the gold edition is on sale for $14 and I’m wondering if the enhancements for the PS5 version are worth upgrading to or is it best to just stick to the PS4 version.

I was in contact with PS support and was informed that it's only 12 months warranty (I live in Sweden) and that my PS5 is no longer covered by the warranty and to fix the problem I'd need to send it in for repairs and pay 2900 SEK (around €276/ $295) and that's almost half the cost of a new PS5.

I've heard that having it horizontal instead of vertical helps but I tried that and the success/ failure rate is about the same as in vertical, is there anything I can really do other than just send it in or just live with it and treat it like a digital PS5?"

PS5,uw7ro4,Current Disappointment,"About 2 months ago I finally bit the bullet and got the PS5 for a relatively decent price all things considered. It works great, the haptic feedback is amazing, the load times are phenomenal and I only had one crash so far. The issue is, I'm pretty much just using it as an upgraded PS4, because sadly the games so far for the 5 have just been so... terrible. 

The moment I had finished setting up I downloaded dying light 2, I had loved the first games flaws and all, got nearly 600 hours into it over the last 5 years or so, I had purposely avoided spoilers, and was excited for the sequel to pick up where the last had left off, search for a cure, and explore a larger parkour and zombie slaying paradise. 

Instead we got parkour so floaty it feels like you're full of helium, combat so utterly tedious you end up trying to run past enemies just so you don't have to deal with them, a story so depressing, cliche and bland it feels like it was written at the last minute, two factions who barely matter, barely any weapons compared to the last game, and an RPG outfit and skill system that feels completely unfinished and useless. 

So after forcing myself through that hot mess just to see the ending and complete it, I moved on to another sequel I was excited about, Horizon: Forbidden west. Yes the game actually came out, though everyone was to busy playing elden ring to notice. 

So, HFW... at first it was great, the open world was huge and diverse, the story and dialogue were interesting, but then.. the combat, so utterly unbalanced you end up changing over to story difficulty just so you don't die to the mandatory boss in the storyline 40 times. The black box quest is bugged to hell, many weapons feel like you're trying to kill a Trex with a nail gun, concentration is supposed to  slow down the game as you aim so you can nail those vulnerable spots right? Well good luck as it seems the arrows go wherever the hell they want sometimes, and when you go into slowmo, the models start to freak out and spaz around like a crate stuck in a wall in Garry's mod. Then the story just slowly gets less and less intriguing, the characters lose motivation, the combat just gets harder and harder, oh and if you think maybe you just need the best gear, go to the arena and get it, yeah I dare you, it's one of the most unbalanced, tedious, and brutal things I've ever seen, and you have to PAY EACH TIME YOU TRY IT. 

now I'm just back to playing my old favorites with thankfully much faster load times and some improved hdr and fr. and the only PS5 game I actually play is vanguard, which is hit or miss depending on the internet of the other players and how many tryhards their are in a given match, and also the weapons are so unbalanced theirs like 3 that are actually worth even using so, it can get boring pretty fast. 

I'm sure I'm gonna get hit with alot of 'git gud' which I guess is to be expected, I'm sure elden ring is amazing, but I don't wanna pay 60 dollars to get destroyed 50 times in a row, to some that's wonderful I get it, it's a challenge to overcome, but to me that just sounds so depressing and exhausting. 

Now I look forward, and pray to God that GOW Ragnarok and Sniper Elite 5 are good, I'm currently playing through sniper elite 4 rn, and somehow this 6 year old game has a stealth system 50 times better than the new gen games. Anyway, I just needed to vent, if you guys have any recommendations for PS5 games feel free to send them my way."

Step 1: 

Go onto PlayStation remote play app on your phone and connect to your PS5

While using the buttons on screen to control, go to *settings* at the top of right of your screen

Step 3:

Go to *accessories*, next go to *general*,  next goto *bluetooth accessories*

Step 4:

Delete the controller(s) you cannot connect

Step 5:

Hold down Ps button + Share button at the same time. Your controller should start flashing.

Step 5: 

Under *accessories found* category your gonna see your controller pop up. Click on it and it will connect

Hopefully this worked for you, stupid problem to have. I didn’t have time to buy a new charger for my remote. So I tried everything and this is the only thing that worked for me. Just used my phone as a remote to get to the Bluetooth category so I can connect it that way."

I just recently got HFW, although it’s beautiful graphically, I enjoy more melee dominant based games, and I feel like this game heavily relies on ranged weapons.

Honestly my game collection has been dry for like a year and I was really bored and jumped the gun on HFW cause it looked dope (not saying it isn’t a great game, I just don’t enjoy the combat mechanics heavily favouring ranged weapons)

I’m looking for games with a 3rd person large open world with good combat mechanics that isn’t too hectic (Soulsborne games included) , I’ve played and looking for something similar to:

Witcher 3
Ghost of Tsushima
Red dead Redemption 2
Spider man miles morales
AC Valhalla
The division
Days Gone
Last of Us 1 &amp; 2

To provide even more context, I’m excited to play (barring any flops 🤞🏽):
Hogwarts Legacy
Forspoken
Black Myth Wukong

Got a PS5 to play games but realized I enjoy a certain set of games and there’s nothing out (that I know of) that honestly grabs my attention.

If you’ve got any suggestion by all means drop some and I’d appreciate it."

Looks like it hits mid 50s drops while swinging and in heavy snow it gets to maybe the 40s, it’s a split 1 or 2 seconds and it’s very jarring. I was looking at clips and asked some buddies how the game was at launch and they said it ran perfectly.

I think it has something to do with the muscle deformation suits, which unfortunately has my favorite suit the Classic one. Apparently the deformation affects frame rate, and it seems to be true as the og suit u get (sportswear) runs perfectly fine.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/HorizonScreenshots/comments/uurepo/can\_anyone\_tell\_the\_difference/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorizonScreenshots/comments/uurepo/can_anyone_tell_the_difference/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k6lc0e/ps5\_screenshots/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k6lc0e/ps5_screenshots/)  


The workaround mentioned there in which you view an existing HDR screenshot on the PS5 and then take a new PNG screenshot of it, seems to almost reach the quality as if it had been saved PNG originally. But only the HDR version viewed on the PS5 has the full HDR effect. I'm really wondering what image format the PS5 uses internally for HDR and if we will ever be able to copy that off the PS5. Also note that in my analysis, none of the sizes matched on the USB versus what the PS5 said they were.  


TLDR: Probably best to save PNG and lose HDR."

PS5,uutxqc,"ThiGames and ""The Jumping Burger"" constantly moving up the ""New Games"" category","So I noticed this trophy-scumming game constantly moving up the New Games list somehow despite having been released 7 days ago. I suspect this is due to them somehow pushing it up by releasing a similar game aka ""The Jumping Taco"" and the fact that there's already another release coming in 6 days called ""The Jumping Pizza."" Considering how low effort these games are and the fact that the new titles are literally pallet swaps, this garbage is shoving down actual indie games and preventing them from getting any real front page advertising on the PSN store.

While this is hardly the first game like this, it is the first to pump them out every week and abuse the system to push them to the top of the games list. There's only one real reason to buy this game too, and that's to inflate your trophy list and platinums, but even then ***what is the point.*** Trophies do absolutely nothing outside of comparing with other uses on a title by title basis, and even then this game sticks out more than a smut game like Waifu Impact.

Does anyone know if they will do this at all? I also know that via the Sony App, there is a setting for ‘Ambient Sound Control’, which also has a ‘focus on voice’ checkbox. Would this do the job when the v-mods mic is attached for sidetone?

After a game session I usely put my console in rest mode to charge my controller. I adjusted the energy settings so that my PS5 gives power to my controller for 3 hours. I didn't select the ""keep connected to the internet"" option, so my console should ONLY give power to my controller for 3 hours.

On the PS4, this option would mean that after 3 hours in rest mode, the console would turn itself off. Completely.

Why doesn't my PS5 turn off after 3 hours in rest mode? I don't want to keep my console in rest mode the whole night. Is there an option I'm missing?"

PS5,utwmg7,The disc drive is a bane of the PS5 experience,"I love my PS5. It took me a long time to finally acquire one, but I finally got one, specifically the disc version.

One of the biggest improvements from the PS4 is the level of noise it makes. Its fan is very quiet, even when playing demanding games. The PS4 sounded like a jet taking off, the PS5 sounds like a small electric fan that you would use on a hot day. The problem, however, is the disc drive at times can completely shatter this improvement. The disc drive spinning at full speed, sounds just like a PS4.

The disc drive in the PS5 is a UHD Blu-ray player. The discs used can be up to 100GB in size. It makes perfect sense for it to spin at full speed when installing a new game, as installing a game as fast as possible is what we all want right? Of course. The problems with the disc drive is *after* the game has installed. There are 2 main problems:

**DRM**

This mechanism within the PS5 causes the disc drive to spin every so often when playing a disc based game. I’ve never timed how frequently it does this, but let’s just say it’s 45 minutes. So every 45 minutes when you’re playing your disc version of Elden Ring, you will hear the disc drive boot up at full speed.

The problem isn’t the DRM process itself, as obviously this mechanism needs to exist so that the console knows the disc is still legitimate and not pirated. The problem is with how fast the disc drive spins the disc. You would think that the disc drive would default to a much slower speed when checking for DRM. But no. It defaults to spinning at maximum speed, like you’re installing the game again.

This is incredibly inconvenient as if you’re playing your games at night and don’t want to disturb loved ones in your room or next door, it can potentially wake them. Why does it have to be this way? Imo, Sony should make it so that DRM checks run at a much slower speed as I don’t see the need to maximum speed for something so non-bandwidth heavy like a DRM check.

**Playing other games**

This is even somewhat more annoying than the previous issue. The PS5 decides to boot up the disc drive upon selecting a game that isn’t even the game you have on disc.

What do I mean? I have Elden Ring in my PS5, I select a digital game I have installed like Call of Duty: Vanguard, yet the disc drive still boots. How does this make sense? Why is Elden Ring spinning when I play a different game? It seems that Sony has programmed this too simplistic. The logic of the software is pretty much play game -&gt; DRM check disc, whereas it should ideally function as play *disc* game -&gt; DRM check.

This makes it frustrating when you’re trying to be quiet around loved ones at night. You think you’re safe playing a different game yet the disc drive decided to boot up anyways.

**Booting up the PS5**

Let’s say you want to avoid these issues at night, by watching Netflix. You have your loved one asleep nearby and you boot up your PS5 without selecting any game to avoid any audible noise from the disc drive or fan. Well tough luck, as the disc drive spins at full speed upon turning the PS5 on.

So no matter what you do, the PS5 will make a racket if you have a disc inside it. The current solution may be “just take the disc out after using it”, but this isn’t the best solution. Ideally, the PS5 should assort to us, not us adapt to it. These inconveniences are all fixable by Sony. Besides, we all live busy lives at least some of do. We don’t all have our PS5s in the back of our mind with every living minute. Being forced to eject the disc at the start of every day so late night gameplay is quiet is inconvenient in itself.

Sony should improve this situation for disc users. There’s no reason the disc drive needs to spin at full speed upon booting up the PS5. There’s definitely no reason it should spin up at all when playing digital games. There’s no reason why it has to spin at full speed when performing DRM checks."

Preferably something where we can play the story together, not just rounds/challenges like overcooked which we've also played some of. 

Fantasy/Medieval is probably ideal, but open to other genres. 

Not super clunky. This is a weird one, but how smooth it all feels makes a big difference. If it feels like crap to play, my wife will give up rather quickly. 

Not too complicated RPG elements. I've played a lot of RPGs and MMOs and whatnot in my life but if there is too deep of a crafting or magic system, it loses my wife. For example, she tried The Witcher 3 and just found it to be too overwhelming to try and learn for someone who doesn't normally play that type of game. But I want some depth for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember we played some of an old lord of the rings game on PS2 that was great some years back but haven't found something that does all the same things. Something like a co-op Skyrim would be perfect. I know there is a mod for PC that we will try at some point. 

But any help or suggestions is appreciated."

My PS5 auto turns on whenever my tv tunes to its HDMI input (HDMI 2 in this case). Is it possible to configure this CEC behavior to not auto turn on when on its HDMI input?

This is an issue because if I play my PS5, turn off the system and tv, then go back to watch TV or something, the TV goes to its last input (HDMI 2) which turns on the PS5, so I have to manually turn it back off before I can switch to watching TV.

I also like the ability to turn on the PS5 and have the TV turn on with it, so I preferably don't want to turn of CEC all together. Is there a solution for this or should I just turn of CEC? Thank you!"

For instance I played FNaF on my PS4, now inserting the same disc in my PS5, it gives me the option to install either the PS4 or the PS5 version, which begs the question why I should install the PS4 version..... My old savegames are unavailable on the PS5 version. Long story short: How can I have my PS4 savefiles on my PS5? (I tried the ps+ cloud, it says synchronized but safefiles are not there) and do they actually give me a free PS5 digital version, meaning I don't have to put in the disc everytime?"

Wasn't too sure if anyone else has had this experience.

I noticed when farming in Elden Ring awhile ago, now with Tiny Tina's duplicating Keys. 

Loading in, killing enemies in about 10 seconds, fast travel to beacon, rinse &amp; repeat.  
After a dozen or so times, it gets slower and slower at loading the fast travel.  
With Tiny Tina's I noticed every time I loaded in same thing the more I did it the slower it would load.

Talking from like 1.5-2 second loading, to 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5... Would always stop around it taking this long as I was happy where I was at, so not sure the extent this will go to or if anyone had has this issue or experimented with it either.

## i)LORE:

Horizon Forbidden west is longer most probably if considering only the cutscenes and total events that occur in the main storyline whereas Elden ring  story is shorter a little if you don’t do anything extra and get the 2 great runes only do the main questline so the rating according to the story of both : **Horizon 9.2 Elden ring 9.1 and remember the 2 stories are of different categories** one is fantasy future world and one is fully new fantasy world and one uses technology improvements and new AI’s whereas the other is based on becoming the Elden Lord and runes and great runes and both containing some interesting twists and in ELDEN RING you can change the ending whereas it’s not possible in HFW but you can change alloy’s personality and choices and be bold ,smart or kind are hear about everyone’s views and stories . for more [visit](https://whyconsole.com/2022/03/19/horizon-forbidden-west-vs-elden-ring-honest-personal-review/) and I mention there more good ones for 2022"

PS5,usm2qs,Moratorium on sales numbers posts for last-gen titles,"Over the last little while, we've had a large influx of sales number posts, and a proportionate influx of modmail about sales number posts.

These posts tend to generate a lot of complaints and reports, but also a large amount of activity — [678 points, 308 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/uriy58/final_fantasy_15_reaches_10_million_copies_sold/), [2515 points, 647 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/un43m1/elden_ring_has_sold_134_million_units/), [2461 points, 567 comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/umc3xu/playstation_5_has_sold_193_million_units_as_of/) — so we don't want to just declare sales posts verboten and stamp out all that discussion, but at the same time, we get a lot of these and feel it's pretty clear the community wants a line drawn somewhere.

Therefore, in the short term, we're going to be allowing sales number posts for *current-gen titles and consoles only*.  So the ever-popular Elden Ring and console sales threads would remain, but stuff like the latest numbers for RDR2 or The Witcher would go.

We feel this is a reasonable compromise, and we'll see what the sub looks like after this change and go from there."

First one is simple. How long do invites last? As in an invite to join a multiplayer game. I know they expire if the person who sent it creates a new lobby but I am wondering how long it takes for them to just time out. 

Second one has to do with disc games and is a bit specific. If I have a PS4 and a PS5, and let’s say I have a PS4 disc game installed on both, and I want to buy another copy of the same PS4 game, can I play the installed file simultaneously as long as a game disc is in both or does it have to be the one specific disc because it’s somehow coded into the console for it to run the file? Again, assuming I have two game discs for the exact same game.

For perspective, I really would like to own all the PS5 exclusives as that is mainly what I bought it for. All other games I use my XSX. On the other hand, in the past I have played the Dishonored games and while I do enjoy them and think they are quite fun they were also always way to challenging for me to where I just lost interest in playing them maybe a 1/4-1/3 through. I have never played Prey so can't speak on that. But what I see of Deathloop and the whole idea of it has me to believe it would probably be a 9 or 10 game for me that I would actually finish.

So in your opinions how do you think it compares to their other titles in this aspect and do you think it is worth me giving a shot for the price tag currently?

Pros and cons of the game are all welcome too.

Thanks."

PS5,us8wxx,Speculated Weapons in God of war Ragnarök and date of release," There is not much information available as to what weapons we’ll be seeing in the new game, but as usual, speculations fueled by the God of war Ragnarök trailer released by the Santa Monica team have been flying around. There are also a few speculations that were motivated mainly by Norse mythology.

**Leviathan Ax** — This weapon which we first saw in God of War (2018), is making a comeback in the new series. Kratos wields it by flinging it and calling it back, holding his arm out just like Thor’s hammer. This video shows it in action.

 

**Gungnir** — This weapon, also known as “The swaying one” is a special spear used by Odin who made an appearance in God of war Ragnarök. We’ve heard rumours of Kratos claiming Gungnir for himself after defeating Odin in the game.

**Laevateinn** — The wand-like weapon which is said to manipulate enemies from a distance. Although Kratos is not one to cast spells, the character who always resorts to using his muscles to fight his way out of any problem may use this weapon in the new game. Some have described this speculation as proof of how mature and refined the new Kratos character will be in God of war Ragnarök.

One thing is for sure. The wait will be worth it. How do we know this? Cory Barlog, a producer on the team, on his Twitter page, celebrated the fourth anniversary of the critically-acclaimed God of War (2018). He also assured fans that his team is full of perfectionists who will stop at nothing to give us the best. That’s a bold statement considering how difficult it will be to deliver something better than the previous god of war games."
PS5,us8t4w,Aiming / Shooting with a controller: how did you get used to it?,"I'm terrible at aiming / shooting with the controller. I recently bought a PS5 and some of the games I'm more excited to try involve shooting, like Cyberpunk and Deathloop.

In the PS4, I abandoned Fallout 4 pretty early on, because I couldn't shoot and I kept dying every time I was attacked. I wanted to play it because I really liked Fallout 3 on the PC (I don't have a PC right now, PS5 is my only gaming option.)

I finished The Last of Us 1 with great effort and didn't like the experience because of how bad I am at shooting. So I'm not even considering playing TLOU2. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time, but I played it with auto-aim. If it's available, I'll use auto-aim (Uncharted, Tomb Raider, RDR2).

But some games don't have the option for auto-aiming. I've watched some youtube videos, but even those seem to be directed to people who are not as bad as I am.

What should I do? Do you think I should play a pure shooter, something free like Apex Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, to improve until I feel comfortable enough to enjoy the single player games that involve shooting? How did you guys get used to aiming / shooting with a controller?"
PS5,us8s1v,"If you live in the states, Microcenter and Amazon sells this Inland 4TB NVMe for $549.99. Uses the Phison E18 controller.", 
PS5,us83ex,It’s really remarkable how many games Sony is selling.,"I just checked how many games alone the Ps4 has sold til 2022 and it blew me away. More than double that of the switch with similar hardware sales, Ps5 is doing also extremely well. And everything with offering free titles per month, Ps now etc and being a mature system with barely casual games. 

Their strategy is right. Period. They don’t need whatever people say they need."
PS5,us7uwd,"Sony will be, one day, one of the richest companies in the world, thanks to Virtual Reality and gaming","Today, VR is only a small branch on a much bigger gaming tree. But one day, the metaverse will be reality and VR devices small and light. The metaverse sounds like a sci fi nightmare when Facebook is talking about it but in reality it’s basically social media 2.0. 

And imagine having then the best VR games and affordable technology. 

Microsoft is right when they say that there are 2 billion potential gamers out there. But you won’t reach them with Gamepass. Not even a Tv app available everywhere can reach 300 million. Not even the casual toaster also known as switch will achieve that. You need something that everybody wants. Like a phone. And VR combined with social media will one day be such a thing. Especially as soon as they are able to combine VR with phones and metaverse. 

Sony are not dumb and have an incredible sense for that. Alone how they changed the camera market on their own was brilliantly."
PS5,us7ork,"Why I think, A Ps5 handheld would have been better investment than VR","First context: 

People love to compare hardware sales. And it looks like, the switch will be one day the best selling system of all time. 

But! It’s not that simple. It not only matters how many you have sold but in what time. The switch will very likely exist til 2027 (because one of their leaders said it’s only at half of the life cycle atm). 

Nintendo Switch is the only money source for Nintendo. While Microsoft makes a lot and will even make a lot more money, from Pc as well. Sony moving to pc as well means that it’s better to have 2 money sources than 1. Because they have seen that pc and console gamers are completely different species 🤣. Not to forget that Microsoft will overall become a service brand not just a hardware based brand. 

It’s also important what kind of system the Switch is. The switch has basically no competition. While Microsoft has Sony and Sony has Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft make mostly games for mature people and core gaming while switch makes casual games for everybody (mostly). 

Yes is a difference and significant if you make a system for families or hardcore gamers 🤷‍♂️ 

Nintendo Switch Games can even be played by non gamers. Like mobile games. That’s what makes it so successful. But Imo, their games are mediocre at best (Mario and Zelda excluded). 

Their games are basically low budget titles my grandma can play why she is on her way with the bus. There is nothing wrong about that, but for the same reason the most successful movies, YouTube videos, games are family or casual products, for the same reason the switch is more successful than other brands. At least hardware wise. 

The Wii was stronger than Ps3 and Xbox 360 but sold much less games per console. Many people buy their systems for maximal 3 games (statistic). While for example ps3/4 had a 9-12 ratio. 

Many YouTubers and news outlets will just say System A sold better than System B, ignoring time, audience, software etc.

And here comes my point which has nothing to do with statics and math: 

I believe that Sony should start producing games like crash, spyro (of course new brands since Microsoft bought them, or will) etc again and then port those games to handhelds. Or just make handheld versions of them. Their studios often are working on 2-3 games at the same time. Why not letting them work on 1 casual and 1 core game? Ratchet, Sackboy would have been amazing casual on the go games. Even Returnal, a core game, would have been cool on the go. Sure, ratchet would not had the ssd trick with the rifts but imo, games can live without that as well. PlayStation has also an amazing lineup of old games which also would fit perfectly on a handheld. 

I know you think I just desperately want a Handheld and you’re right 🤣. Sony is wasting a huge potential here. Letting Nintendo dominate the market with underwhelming games just because there is nothing else. And no, Valves console is too big, too core, has no exclusives. It’s not a real competition. After the hype it will die out pretty soon. Will 100% not sell 100 million pieces lol. 

Anyway, let me know what you think."

PS5,urufkh,PS5 Disk Edition or Digital Edition for Birthday Gift?,"Hi everyone! I'll keep this short.

I am not a console person, mostly PC and occasionally my Switch. My partner's birthday in June and I'd like to get him a PS5 that he's been wanting. Would it be better to get my partner a Disk edition of the PS5 or the Digital Edition? He is also a big PC gamer and doesn't like the clutter of disks, but before I go on this journey of trying to hunt one down I'd like to know which one is more favored/the better option.

Thank you!"
PS5,urtldm,Black screening,"So i just got a brand new 70"" vizio M6 series qled tv. I had been playing on my monitor 27"" lg ultra gear 165 hz for a while now with no issues. I wanted to try it on the new tv in 4k at 60 hz just because i never experienced it before. I hooked it up to the tv and worked fine the first day.. the 2nd day worked fine, the 3rd day i started up the game was hust messing around on vanguard zombies trying to level some guns up and after i clicked start match I notice my screen went black, i wiggled the hdmi very gently on the back of my ps5 and the picture came back on played for that night. The next day i booted up the game and nothing but black screen tried different hdmi inputs on my tv and still nothing, unplugged hdmi from my tv and put it back into my monitor and it works just fine... ?

PS5,urs9te,I beat Sonic Adventure,"I FINALLY DID IT! I beat Sonic Adventure on the PS3 via PSNow using a 100% clear save file on my PS5 digital! That Super Sonic's final story's final boss was easy I had goosebumps! Even though it was a DX port (or DX remake) from the PC version it's all the same with or without the DX DLC upgrade! I had to record videos on my phone of Amy running to Sonic before She gives Him the emerald with and without subtitles! Amy's Story is short but I had to keep Her with that save file I have! I have to let go of the analog stick to stop Amy from sprinting (the one with the hammer) or I can press the action button to stop it to a hammer attack halt! The Chao races are fun when you take good care of the Chao in Chao Garden! Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are the ones I beat since I stopped playing it on a PS3 a decade ago! But when I come back to playing it on PSNow, boy I sure had a blast playing it! Amy's boots are rounded instead squared and I like them when She does alot of gameplay and cutscene animations from Her boots! I'm never gonna stop playing that game again! I can play it forever and ever and never stop! After I beaten the whole game I said ""So long Sonic Adventure on PSNow, bye."" and turned off the PS5! I really sure enough had a blast! Can't wait for Sonic Origins to come out next month.

Congratulations to Me!"

I know Guardians is supposed to be excellent, and is actually full price now at $59...is it worth grabbing the bundle for the cheaper price or waiting til GOG goes on sale on its own?

And just how bad is Avengers? Is it at least a fun play through with buddies?

PS5,ur1msf,Update on LG OLED B8 to C9 conversion,"Not long ago I created a Post about converting an OLED B8 TV to C9 by just swapping out the main board, WiFi module, and the magic remote.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg\_oled\_b8\_can\_be\_converted\_to\_a\_c9\_model\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg_oled_b8_can_be_converted_to_a_c9_model_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Now that I did the conversion I would like to give you an update:

1. **Getting the parts**  
This was actually easy. I searched eBay for those parts and ordered those which were the cheapest including shipping. 
2. **Preparation**  
I had to clean the new main board because it had metal flakes on the back. I guess the Italian workshop it came from is about recycling defective TV's and reselling parts. I did this with Isopropanol alcohol and a soft brush. I rinsed the main board with alcohol and then brushed off the metal flakes and residue. Only make sure to not flush out the cooling paste, but reapplying new one should not be an issue.   
Before doing the installation i factory reset my B8 TV in case I want to resell the main board and WiFi module, I would like to prevent someone else logging into my accounts.
3. **Installation**  
Literally all I needed was a Philipps PH1 screw driver. I recommend getting one with a magnetic tip. The hardest part was getting the back cover off, which is attached with clips to the rest of the TV. Then I had to remove all ribbon cables from the main board, unscrew it, replace it with the C9 main board, and put back the ribbon cables. Just make sure you unlatch the data cables properly and avoid ripping the off or ripping out the ribbon cable connectors. Replacing the WiFi module required unscrewing the whole fixture. The new WiFi module is smaller but fits perfectly well into the fixture. The new main board fit perfectly and all connectors are the same and in the same place.   
Worth noting: Since the (at least mine) B8PLA model already had a headphone jack, I din't need to unsolder it nor did I need to cut out a square hole into the back cover.
4. **Setup**  
After connecting the network, power, and HDMI cables I turned on the TV and it immediately greeted me in Italian language. I realized that the remote which came with my B8 model still works, but I used the new one since I already got it. Not sure if some functions won't work. Then it took me a little while change the language to English.   
First thing I did is factory reset the TV. I had to enter a 4 digit code to do so. My first guess 1111 worked, but after resetting the 4 digit code is actually 0000.  Setting up the TV was easy, and I immediately realized that it's faster.
5. **Testing with PS5**  
First the good news. PS5's screen settings info showed that 120Hz at 4K are supported and VRR is supported within a range of 48-120 Hz. 4K@120Hz works without an issue.  
Now the bad news. In Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition when testing at 4K 120 Hz with VRR on (aka Instant Game Response on C9) I had a black screen. In Ratchet and Clank I had partially a black screen. Not sure why this is. I would be interested if anyone else is having the same experience with their original C9 models.  


**TL/DR:** Converting my 55B8PLA to a 55C9MLB model was quite easy. Contrary to my previous post, I did not need a new remote. 4K@120Hz works but I am having black frames or completely black screen with VRR on.   


I will update this article if anything changes (e.g. after a PS5 or C9 update, or if I experience any issues)."

However I really did not like assasins creed and I’m curious if Elden going to be similar. I found AC very slow and drawn out at times. The fighting felt machanical and repetitive. I get alittle bored with hand to hand combat games as opposed to shooters so maybe that’s part of it. I’ve just heard so many good things about Elden and want to give it a shot but don’t want to end up the same way I did with AC. Any input from the masses?"

You're receiving this email because you ordered DEATH'S DOOR from Special Reserve Games. We are just emailing you to inform you of a small delay; no action is necessary from you.

Over the last year we have been working to improve our warehouse operation, and bring as much of it in-house as possible. Right now, we are assembling DEATH'S DOOR Switch Reserves, and will be shipping them soon. Switch Singles will begin shipping on Monday.

We are seeing a delay on the PS5 games, which have to be assembled by Sony. We will be shipping Switch games shortly but we expect that PS5 games will experience a shipping delay of a couple of weeks. We still hope to be shipping them this month, but it's possible we might end up shipping them in the first week of June.

Many of the earliest orders for this game included both Switch and PS5 games. For these customers, we have set aside low-numbered Switch games to be packaged into their shipments later on when the PS5 games are ready to ship.

We just wanted to let you know this, and update everyone who ordered the game on its progress. Here are a few pics from the assembly floor. We're really pleased how the game name and Sarge's seal turned out!"

4. *Nightmare Creatures*

PS5,uqvxg3,Ubisoft+ vs Ubisoft+ Classics,"I see a lot of people misunderstanding these two services, so I will try to put it in simpler words.
From Ubisoft News: https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/bPREDsvbMwS7wKIHlnVF1/ubisoft-coming-to-playstation 
&gt; Ubisoft+ will come to PlayStation in the future, bringing access to more than 100 titles, additional content packs, and rewards to the platform. The subscription service is currently available on PC, Stadia, and Amazon Luna, offering players day-one releases, classic games, and premium editions, and ultimately will be available on PlayStation and Xbox.

So, Ubisoft+ that's currently available on PC, Stadia and Luna will be coming to PlayStation store as a separate subscription service that will probably cost the same as on PC (15$). What's revealed today is a new Ubisoft+ subscription ""tier"" that's included with PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium.
&gt; Ubisoft also revealed that beginning May 24, it will launch a **new** Ubisoft+ subscription for PlayStation Plus called Ubisoft+ Classics. Ubisoft+ Classics on PlayStation is a **curated selection** of popular games, including top-selling Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, The Division, and For Honor, as well as beloved classic games like Child of Light, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Watch Dogs, Werewolves Within, and more. The Ubisoft+ Classics catalogue for PlayStation Plus will launch with **27 titles and will grow to 50 by the end of 2022**

It will have 27 titles at launch and will expand to 50 by the end of the year. It won't have new releases (at least for now, we will have to wait), probably no DLCs too. We don't know if they will add new games after half or full year like EA+ on gamepass does as they don't state it anywhere (again, gotta wait). 

TLDR: Ubisoft+ with all new releases and DLCs is separate from PS+; Ubisoft+ Classics is included with PS+, but has 27 (later 50) older games."

PS5,uquuuo,Background static/hissing/white noise coming from headphones wired into Dualsense,"I just purchased a PS5 and when using headphones wired into the Dualsense there is a feint hissing/white noise whenever there is audio. If there is no audio then it's completely silent, so it's not a constant background noise. And if I turn the headphone volume down in the PS5 menu all the way to zero you can still hear the white noise. 

I have tried 3 different headphones and I have just got the store I bought the PS5 from to replace the Dualsense and the same issue. Also I don't get this noise when using a PS4 pad.

Is it mean to be like this or do I have a faulty PS5? The best way to test is to just by being on the home screen and navigating around. Turn off home screen music but leave on sound effects.

I don't want to send back my PS5 for an exchange if this is just the way it is meant to be.

PS5,uqaq44,Any way to authenticate a PS5 disc without installing?,I’ve been shopping for the new ratchet and clank and found a seller and I asked if they could send a video playing the game to make sure it’s not broken and then said they’ve already uninstalled it. I’ve heard that PS5 installs the game digitally and only needs the disc to know what game it is and not use the data on the disc to play. So if they sent a video of inserting the disc and the game icon appearing and then starts downloading be enough proof?
PS5,uqa6nc,Display area glitch with ps5 on A80J,"Hey guys, 

Just got the a80j in 77” screen size about a week ago and have been trying to use it with my ps5 but keep getting issues with sound and video.

I’ll first explain the display area glitch. There are times where part of the video signal from the ps5 is cut off on the right or left side but the opposite side has just dead space… just pixels that are turned off. Only way I have found to fix it is doing a hard restart of the tv. Restarting the PS5 did nothing in my case.

Now for the sound glitch. I have a Denon 3300 AVR but chose against using it because of how much sound lag there is with it. Problem is that if my PS5 is on and I try to switch my sound from external to internal tv speakers it introduces about 100ms of sound lag. So then I have to go into my ps5 sound settings and change it from PCM to DTS and then back to PCM. This reduces the sound lag coming from the tv speakers from about 150ms back down to 50ms. I can’t seem to figure out if it’s something with the ps5 or the TV that is causing this issue. 

Also why is there any lag at all when my ps5 is plugged directly into the tv, so the sound from the tv speakers should have zero delay but it still has about 50ms? Any input to enlighten me is very welcome. Thank you in advance"

My question is, should I do that? I added the warranty on the controller because of all the issues I've seen on YouTube. I believe it's $120 Canadian for 2 years of direct replacement. Although, there might be some wait currently because of stock issues.

It's £70 for a digital copy of it and it's around £55 for a disc copy on Amazon. I checked used copies and it's around £40-50. So I'm just wondering does this game ever go on sale? It's been out for like 2 years(?) And it's still being sold next to full price pretty much. But there's other games that have been released for around the same time and are now less than £20 (AC Valhalla). Why is that? 

I remember before I used to buy new copies for £40 on release and now I can barely get a used copy for that much depending on the game even a year or two later. I know there's a lot of factors that go into it but it kinda sucks."

PS5,upqrug,got a ps5 today n got to say i was blown away by the most unlikely game....,"been gaming for over 30 years from the high profile arcades, from my first ever machine the spectrum zx sinclare and everything since,  sorta been shoe horned into the xbox family since the 360 purely because the ps3 got delayed so much , when i did eventually get a ps3 i was very underwhelmed, the ps4 iv had for a while and always been impressed with the exclusives, i stood by my guns and said (being an mainly an xbox gamer) that nothing on the alternate consoles looked even as good as infamous 2nd son....

&amp;#x200B;

iv gone through every iteration of the xbox since the 360, and since the one X was release iv always stood by my own opinion and even owning the series S and X when MS boasts they have the most powerful console available , yes thats all well and good to claim it but show me ..... and iv had both the Series Consoles the S over a year the X since Xmas and they are both nice and shiny but iv missed that new gen feeling, when you upgraded to ps2 and you saw GTA3 for the first time it dropped your jaw, when RDR dropped your brains flew out , when you played mario 64 it was like omfg what is this devilry. but since then iv had nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

today i picked a ps5 up from the most unlikely place and all the way home was like eesh should i have bought this, loaded it up and i had 2 new gen games to impress me, horizon being the game i was expecting to be amazing..... but then the one that never expected anything from at all or even heard of which i instantly fell in love with and not only did i expect nothing from but made me fall back in love with nostalgia and gaming again ......... the astro game...

&amp;#x200B;

It hits every nail on the head, simplistic gaming, charm, amazing sound, the nostalgia of many years of gaming , great graphics, fun gameplay, it just took me back through 30 years of gaming and doesnt try to be anything special or standout it just hits all the basics that so many games miss these days, it looks nice yes but its no nawty dog game or whatever but as someone who has been gaming years upon years and got lost in graphics, or addicted to achievements or whatever other fad has come along , gaming at its heart has become lost for being what its meant to be and thats fun........ this game brought it all back and id say for any developer and especially MS who have tried to shove yukaleele or however its spelled and recore or all this fails mascots down our throats take a note this game blew my mind in ways it shouldnt...

&amp;#x200B;

anways iv waffled enough iv had a beer but yeh any buyers remorse i had instantly went away with this game and even though its a fkin unit of a machine and iv had to build an extension to get it in my house, ps5 has made me do what no console has done in years..... and thats fall in love with it instantly..."

PS5,upifkt,Wired Headphones Not Detected?,"Hey all,

As of a few hours ago, my controller does not seem to detect any (wired) headphones.

Whenever I plug a pair of headphones into my controller, they are simply not detected. I have tried multiple different pairs but none of them seem to work (despite all previously working). When I go to my sound settings, the audio output is still via the HDMI cable - as if no headphones were even detected in the first place.

This is especially annoying because just two weeks ago, I returned my controller to Sony for a repair - it just gave up and stopped working (random inputs, unresponsive buttons etc.). I only received it back a few days ago but everything seemed to be working fine (the only thing I noticed is that pressing touchpad sounded a bit flimsy).

Has anybody else experienced this? Is there a fix or should I just return the controller *yet again*?"

PS5,updru6,PS5 hardly read my disc,"Hi all,

So I have a PS5 with built-in optical drive however I'm usually purchasing games digitally.

Now -after finishing Elden Ring - I've got the idea to play Sekiro again.

I have a physical copy. (This is the first disc I'm trying to insert since I've got the console last may)

So I just inserted the disk, the drive spinned for like 2 seconds and I've got the error that the disc cannot be recognized.

I've tried it again and again.

After a while, I was able to install the game from disc, however, since the installation, the game is not booting and the PS don't recognize the disc again. 

Console is laying horizontally (I've read somewhere that the standing position might cause these issues, it's not the case here)

The disc is near perfect condition, as I've used it only once or twice on PS4 (2-3 hours of game time maximum), I've cleaned it with microfiber tissue, tried to reboot the PS, even from safe mode, rebuild the database, etc... System software is up to date. Nothing seems to help.

What do you think? Has anyone encountered this same issue? 

My biggest concern is, that somehow I was able to install the game from the disc, but before and after, it's non-recognised again.

What do you think, might it be a hardware issue? Dust in the optical drive, etc?"

But alas, I went ahead and replay the mission in Kurosawa Mode and as much as I hate to say it, it was quite good at this increased frame rate. Now it's still not a superior experience to the original frame rate on PS4 Pro, mind y'all. But it was a decent enough test run for this game."

Because I've heard that the PS4 games play off the external storage itself and you have to transfer them over to the main storage to play them with the PS5 capabilities/features. If that's true, it really sucks and means I'll have to juggle them between each quite alot, as i want to keep the system storage just for necessary PS5 titles if I can."

PS5,up1esn,"In my (limited) experience, PS5 games look more crisp on a 1080p screen because many don't hit true 4K at 60fps.","I've had my PS5 for about a year, and I've been playing it on a 1080p 60hz TV the entire time. The picture is crisp and from the distance I'm at, it looks great!

I took my PS5 to a friend's house that has a 4K TV and the image for a few games I tried was just not as good. It was blurrier in my opinion.

Doing some research since then I'm finding that there aren't that many games that run at a true 4K 60 on the PS5. Many are checkerboard or dynamic resolution which doesn't quite hit 4K, or they're 1440p at their performance mode. Often the quality mode is native 4K but runs at 30fps which I don't like. So many games seem to be upscaled to 4K which doesn't look as good as native and it appears blurry to me after seeing them on a 1080p screen.

Seems like all of this, on a 1080p screen creates a better picture because it's either native resolution or higher and it's downscaled nicely to 1080p.

To play games at 60fps and retain a crisp resolution, seems like upgrading from a 1080p TV isn't really a good idea with this console. Happy to be proven wrong on the technical details of the games, but that's my experience so far.  I'm sure there are well optimized exceptions out there and yes, the performance mode probably makes other visual sacrifices. But I'm talking about purely resolution and FPS as that's what looks ""good"" to my eyes.

I kinda expected more from PS5 but it seems like the trend will be in the direction of more 30fps titles if we want native 4K. Do you think developers will push to optimize for 4k 60 as the console matures, or do you think they'll pack in as much expensive visuals as they can and just cap it at 30?"

I've never had this issue with a controller before, and have usually been a fan of the PS controllers (DS2 and 3 being favourites).

The bottom one came off quite easy, didn't need a lot of force. But the to top one, my god, it took me 30 mins of gently pushing it. Had to push so hard that i actually injured me finger. And yes I've watched many guides. There was simply no movement. Eventually got it off, and ended up scratching it inside. Was able to clean it with a sponge. So unless you put it in the light you won't see it. Plus snapping it back was quite a challenge as well.

Guess i won't be playing games for a while :/"

PS5,uoif5m,Scenes reminiscent of God of War 4 Blades Of Chaos scene,"I've noticed a couple things about the blades of chaos part that typically happen near the 3rd act of a game or movie. 

1. The character is in a tough situation
2. The atmosphere is super dark
3. The protagonist has to utilize something shown earlier to achieve success. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple examples of this: 

Persona 5: &gt;!When you finally get to the interrogation room, and it looks like Akechi kills you, but he was really sent to the metaverse. !&lt;

Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness:&gt;! When Strange loses the girl America and then has to possess the zombie corpse. !&lt;

Spider-Man Homecoming: &gt;!When Peter finds out Liz's dad is the vulture, and has to lift the lockers to get his spider suit. !&lt;

I’m also unable to enter safe mode. When I hold the power button down for 7 seconds the screen remains black, as if there’s no input. 

Weirdly, I managed to access safe mode once and changed my HDR settings, but that didn’t work either. I’ve not able to access safe mode since. It seems that one time was a total fluke.  

Also, my controller won’t turn on. This surely can’t be an unrelated issues, but it doesn’t even charge when I plug it into the wall. It just flashes orange once and then turns off. 

Has anyone else had similar issues? I’m thinking that I must have a faulty model. It’s just strange to have these problems with a brand-new console."

PS5,unqkxl,How does game share works between two PS5?,"My buddy is finally getting a PS5 and we are new to PlayStation, if someone owns an Xbox you know you can pretty much share everything with someone else (subscription, games, etc.) so I'm wondering if here we can do the same since I have a pretty decent library by now, thanks in advance!"
PS5,unpng7,"Recently my PS5 fan has started to be extremely loud every time I play a PS5 game that's on my console storage. However, if I play a PS4 game off my external hard drive it's 100% silent. Has anybody experienced this and know a fix for it?","When playing a PS5 game that's on my console storage it is loud literally 100% of the time while playing it. It started a couple months ago and u noticed it with WWE 2K22, then Ghostwire Tokyo, and now a game as simple as Trek to Yomi. Does anybody know why this is happening and if there is a fix for it?"
PS5,unp370,Washed out on HDR?,"So I just started my PS5 up, and everything is washed out when I have it on HDR. I've followed all suggested means of fixing it from changing the settings on the PS5 and my TV, to unplugging, and restarting. I've even gone in and rebuilt the database. Nothing is working. When I turn off HDR on the ps5, colors go back to being fine. 

Has anyone found a fix for this problem? All the threads I can find are from a year ago with nothing recent."
PS5,unoqxy,PS5 Controller Randomly Died,"Hey everyone so I’ve had my PS5 for a little over a year. A few days ago the controller that came with the console wouldn’t turn on. It was plugged in via cable to the front overnight, but for some reason it didn’t charge. Realizing this the next I then tried to plug it in the back port waited 15 min… nothing. I went out and bought a new controller along with a charging station. I let the stock controller sit on that thing while I played Elden Ring for about an hour and it still won’t turn on. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve done research online and tried a lot of suggestions and nothing seems to work."

PS5,unngz8,Spiderman Remastered ps5 voucher code,"Hey guys!
Recently purchased MM Ultimate, but unfortunately and to my bad luck cant redeem the voucher code for Spiderman Remastered that comes with it. Reason being my account is US and the voucher would only work for either UK or/maybe EU accounts i guess (please confirm). Voucher code expires 01/01/2024
My heart breaks but what can you do, really looked forward to playing it.
Is there a kind soul in UK region who'd swap the codes with me haha or i can just give it whoever got a UK account i guess. Or whatever you guys advise me to, would appreciate."
PS5,unmyu4,"PS5 Controller left stick sometimes flip flops the input left to right, any fixes?","Basically if I put my left stick directly to the right, it thinks I'm putting it straight left. If it's not perfectly to the right then it senses it normally as bottom-right or up-right. Tried googling but didn't see any other people with this problem.

It's not like the stick is drifting or anything, just flip flopping the input to the left. Only started a couple days ago and it makes it pretty hard to play certain games like rocket league lol.

Any ideas or tips/fixes? Never had a controller do this before"

I seem to be in the minority for whom the new controller causes hand pain (escalating from mild to severe). I'd love to be able to, like, actually play PS5 games on my PS5.

I came across an article mentioning remote play, but I don't understand this sentence:  
""In fact, you can skip game streaming altogether and just play on the TV your PS5 is connected to, using remote play as a sort of controller interpreter.""

Can anyone interpret? Thanks!"
PS5,unh1qc,Out of these games which would you recommend I get?,"These are the games I put on my wishlist: Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Deathloop, Elden Ring, Dying Light 2, and Ratchet &amp; Clank. 

I only have enough for one game as of now, which game would you recommend? with regards to Elden Ring I don’t usually like games that are too difficult so bare that in mind, i would get it though if that’s what is recommend, I am up to try something harder so the difficulty although a factor isn’t the be-all and end-all"

PS5,unelri,It’s coming up on 2 years since TLOU2 released. What are your expectations for the multiplayer?,"Having stated the games scope was too large to release alongside the single player, it wouldn’t be wild to assume they’re going to attempt to capitalise on the popular larger scale multiplayer games of recent.

Core systems like mobility, looting, combat etc. are already in place to compliment something like a Battle Royale or Tarkov experience.

Do you think they’ll follow the curve or just expand on what they already have with Factions?"
PS5,unea11,issues when playing my PS5,Hey guys I'm currently having issues when on my ps5 seems to be happening alot so I bought a new gaming TV and I hooked my ps5 up to it and for some reason sometimes I get hdmi signal lost then two seconds later I get hdmi signal received. I don't know what causing this as it only happens if for example I click on destiny and as it loads up I get hdmi signal lost then recieved or in a middle of a game the same thing happens. It doesn't happen often but just randomly however everytime I load up destiny before the sign in screen it always happens any help would be amazing thank you.

1. A Marvel Heroes type game
2. A Marvel MMO like the DC game where u create ur own character
3. Another Avengers Alliance
4. A Smash Bros type Marvel game

I sound frustrated because these are the type of games that I love and think will do great, but everyone is focused on making the next Dark Souls and Fortnite"
PS5,unakps,Console sharing is OP on PS4/PS5s,"Me and my cousin who also owns a PS5 pretty much split all of our video game purchases through file sharing and bought insurgency sandstorm awhile back. Our roommate has a PS4 pro and wanted to hop in our squad so just out of curiosity I let him file share it too, not only did it let him download it but it didn’t even kick me off my profile while he was going through the steps on my account on his PS4. Boom now we’re all 3 playing Insurgency

Fast forward to last week, a friend of mine (PS4) are in a party and I suggest for him to buy Insurgency but he doesn’t have the funds. I told him to try and file share and it works once again. My brother (PS5) sees us playing and asks how the game is and at this point I’m just like try it for yourself and tell him to file share it too lol no surprise it works and we are all three playing at the same time. 

So that’s 5 consoles playing one license and I KNOW it wasn’t like when it was just PS4 consoles. Have any of you had similar experiences?"

For years now, soccer games have been almost exclusively just FIFA and PES. Both required the yearly $60ish investment for mostly a roster update and maybe a couple new features and gameplay upgrades.

In the (hopefully near) future, we the gamers will have at least 5 new games to choose from! Those games will be EA Sports FC, FIFA's rival to EASFC, eFootball, UFL and GOALS. The latter 3 are/will be free to play which I assume that EASFC and its rival will continue to do yearly releases at a $60ish price point.

Personally, I've already given up on FIFA, so EASFC and it's rival aren't for me. I'm excited to see where these other companies choose to take the idea of a soccer game. It will be very interesting to see what sort of features, animations, game modes, etc get included in order to give each game its own unique feel.

eFootball is already available for free and while it's definitely rough around the edges (and there honestly isn't very much content right now) it's a nice change of pace from what FIFA is. Over time I'm sure it'll get even better to compete with FIFA, at least in the short term.

All that being said, I just wanted to find out which of these y'all are most excited for. For me, it's GOALS! On paper, they seem to have a ridiculously cool concept and I think if they manage to pull it off and simultaneously deliver a game that feels satisfying to play, then they'll run away with the market. If you haven't already, definitely check them out to see what sort of ideas they're wanting to bring to the table! Share your thoughts on how you think the soccer game landscape will change in the coming months/years!"

PS5,umwg0y,"TLOU pt1 is one of the best role playing games ever, in the truest sense of the word.","I love an action RPG. I finished the mass effect trilogy. I saw my choices affect the final outcome. I finished the Fallout games, Witcher, Skyrim, Diablo, Outer Worlds, all the Soulsborne games and many more action RPG's. I enjoyed them all but I never felt like there was an emotional weight behind my choices and actions, I never truly felt like I was *playing the role* of the main character. 

By the last act of TLOU pt1 I realised I felt something I hadn't experienced before in a video game - I *really cared* what happened to Ellie. I felt a weight of responsibility I couldn't explain.  I don't know if it's down to the brilliant writing, pacing and voice acting or something else, but no other game has truly made me feel like the decisions I made as the the main character really *mattered* like this one did. 

I think sometimes when you're creating something you can very occasionally stumble upon a magical combination that is far greater than the sum of it's parts, and Naughty Dog caught lightning in a bottle with the way they constructed Joel and Ellie's unfolding relationship.

This is why my truest 'role playing' experience to date came from an action adventure game that isn't even technically an RPG."

I mean, just look at some of the games made on the ps4. Last of us 2 (wether you hate it or not) has some of the best animation in gaming. Bloodborne, Horizon zero dawn, God of war, Ghost of tsushima, Control, and Spiderman were also  great games on the ps4. Really, if the best performance dictated wether a game was good or not Im sure there would be pc exclusive games. Heck, look at Nintendo. Their games have the worst performance out of the consoles yet, they make some of the greatest games to date.

I also found elsewhere that there's a lore message mentioning the pathfinder's tale in the closest obelisk to every pathfinder's tale location in each plateau. Also tried that but nothing.

I'm playing on the apple arcade but figured I'd ask here if anyone had experienced the same.

Tbf my game was already kinda glitched on my iPad where a few achievements didn't show up as complete even though I had done so (forest whisperer, observatory, textile workshop puzzle), but then I reloaded the game on the Apple TV and just had to redo it (forest whisperer) or go back to the location for it to be completed."

Moving from Australia to the UK and bringing my PS5 with me. I know the console itself will work as will UK games I purchase there. But since my PSN account was set up in Australia I believe that DLC and any online stuff will be tricky. Are the games in the UK in the same region as Australia? Just got off the phone with Sony and they said they weren't sure.

Just want to know if I buy a game in the UK and some DLC comes out for it, that I will be able to buy it, or will I have to start a new PSN account and lose all my stuff from my Aussie PSN account? Thank you!"

Also I know that all my Aussie bought PS5 games will work on the console when I bring it over, as well UK PS5 bought games. But will I be able to buy DLC in the UK for UK bought PS5 games? Or purchase DLC for my Aussie bought PS5 games in the UK? I know you can't change your PSN region so I know I'll be still functioning under the AUS store. But I just want to know that I will be fine buying UK PS5 games and to be able to download stuff for those games (or any other apps from the store) whilst living in the UK.

All and all, will my PS5 function in the UK if bought in Australia? And will I be able to download DLC for UK bought PS5 games. Essentially will my PS5 function identically as it does in Australia?

Thanks!"

PS5,um8ib7,Replacement Instead of Repair?,"My PS5 sent got received by Sony for repairs for the second time for the same exact issue. It seems like it had Power Supply issues and used to hard crash or brick within minutes of me playing PS5 titles. I've had the console since Day 1 and it first became faulty and was repaired within 9 months of use.. Then again (now) within 8 months of repair.

I've contacted support and even wrote them a note along with my hardware asking them to please replace my console instead of repairing it since I'm uncertain about the future of my console's lifespan and I didn't want to pay for out of pocket charges for an initially faulty console. Sounds reasonable right? At least I'd hope.

Due to the prevalence of complaints about the drive simply being loud, I've had a hard time finding similar experiences. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Was there any fix you found that worked? 

I've tried opening the machine up and adjusting the drive screw clockwise with a disc in until it is ejected manually. A much shorter/milder version of this noise early on was fixed by that technique, but it doesn't work now.

Unfortunately I'm well outside of warranty. Has anyone had to deal with Sony for an out of warranty fix for their PS5? All my original Sony hardware even back to the PSOne are still running fine, never had to deal with them for repairs."

Nothing else was brought into the house that would interfere with them. The distance at which I play hasn't changed (10-15 feet). Both consoles are out in the open and not closed behind stuff. When I say all controllers are acting weird, this includes the original version PS5 controller, a new controller that was released recently (the purple one), the PS5 media remote, and the joycons for the Switch."

In resolution mode you have the regular unresponsive mess that 30 fps brings, but with a very clear image.

While in the 60fps mode, and arguably the only way to play an action game given the option, looks like a blur 

I wish the developers would design the games in regards to the hardware it’s launching on. Why push the graphics so much, only to cripple the game play.

Just dial down the fidelity a notch and give us a clear image and 60 fps, which should’ve been the standard going forward with ps5."

PS5,uly541,PS5 connectivity issues,"Bought the console back in November and ever since I’ve been having issues with the wifed connection.

I can’t play Warzone and I keep getting disconnected every 1-2 mins in Elden Ring, it works on Apex, but for it to work, in-game Apex has to say it’s unable to connect to the internet (Code 100 i think id the error) and then it manages to connect snd work flawlessly from there on.

While downloading I’ve had issues where it sometimes just stops downloading and/or downloads veeeery slowly, but sometimes it downloads flawlessly.

I have two wired connections that I’ve created, let’s call them 1 and 2, 1 is the wired connection that the Playstation automatically created and 2 is the one that i manually created when i searched my router info on my PC, for instance, 1 works perfectly on Apex but won’t work on other games, 2 works on other games but won’t on Apex.

I called my ISP months ago when these issues were first bothering me and they said that they don’t see any issues and that it’s probably my PS5’s fault, i called the shop where i bought the PS5 they told me it probably isn’t the PS5 that’s faulty since they didn’t have anyone return their PS5 because of this issue, *but* some people have already complained about the same thing.

I don’t know what to do, I literally cannot play Warzone, it’s not able to connect at all, i keeps disconnecting from Elden Ring, but if i connect via Wifi every game works perfectly, which tells me that there obviously is an issue with the wired connection"

As I understand it, contracts for voice acting were different back in the day and only provided rights to the voices for a certain amount of time. So if the company wanted to re-release a game now that had voices, they would have to draw up new contracts with the entire voice cast and pay them for usage again. However, I haven’t used PS Now before, so I was curious: Are there any PS1 games currently on the service that have voice acting?"

I got my PS5 in February of 2021, and as of April 2022 my DualSense is completely unusable. The first issue popped up around 6 months in when something snapped in my right trigger that caused the trigger to become very loose and sensitive to even the slightest amount of pressure. This was annoying, but it didn't seem to effect the adaptive trigger functionality and ultimately I got used to dealing with it. A couple months later, the same thing happened to the left trigger.

The biggest issue began this year when the dreaded stick drift started to kick in on the right stick. It started off pretty mild but it's progressed to the point now where it's so severe that I am totally incapable of playing any game that uses the right stick. Keep in mind that I take extremely good care of all of my tech. I cleaned the DualSense regularly, never played rough with it and never even dropped it, and the amount of time that I regularly used it would be considered moderate to low by most standards.

I am fairly disappointed that the ""future of gaming controllers"" has barely lasted me a year of use. This stings even more considering that my launch Dualshock 3 still works perfectly."

I have been transferring data for well over 12 hours and I’m still at 9% on the save and user data. Stellaris hasn’t even begun downloading, it’s just the save and user data. I am doing this over wifi, but I haven’t seen anyone else on the internet’s who’s data transfer has taken this long.

PS5,uljcev,"good WIFI speeds, terrible live gaming","Got a PS5 back in November of 2021. Worked amazing in all aspects.

Recently over the past week or so Ive noticed an issue where I'm having good WIFI speeds (download 125-150 mbps upload 13 to 15 Mbps) but whenever I'm playing a video game (any multiplayer game) I'm getting horrific lag and icons saying slow/low Internet connections.

Has this been occuring for anyone else? I've changed my WIFI channel, rebooted my router and modem, turned off and turned on PS5, and even forgot/disconnected from my wifi network and no dice.

I think next maybe port forwarding but I can't believe I have to go through all of this when it was NEVER a issue with my PS4.

Would love/appreciate any help/feedback/insight. Thank you!"

After a few hours I found myself going down the same paths so figured I'd google to see how to progress, before realising I'd seen the entire game.

Don't get me wrong it was fun and a different experience to most games, but I thought I'd just scratched the surface and the concepts introduced early on would then open up and evolve as the game progressed.

Just curious what you guys thoughts are? I don't mean to shit on the game, it was a fun original idea but just felt so brief to me."

PS5,uleof8,New dualsense triggers vs old dualsense triggers,"So I just got a new ps5, the new model with the updated dualsense (CT1A), with an extra controller which happened to be the old one (CT1)

What I noticed is that when I do the controller demo and test the adaptive triggers the new controller sounds louder.. the old model sounds better and quieter.. 

Anyone else can confirm this?"

PS5,uldvwp,What let PS Now down?,"With the new PS Plus service rolling out soon, I was just wondering what caused PS Now to be so poorly received. 

It did have a good collection of games, but was let down by the streaming. MK9 for instance is unplayable due to the latency and lag even on a super fast connection. &amp; since it's a PS3 game it can't be downloaded. 

Downloaded games are great and work like a charm, but only being able to stream games that were older than the PS3 kinda sucks, although understandable.

Very few 1st party games come on PS Now, and only recently have they started to join the service at all. However I really don't see this as a bad thing as it keeps the quality of the games high (most anyway). Adding Returnal is honestly very generous of them. 

The thing is, I don't see many things changing with the new PS Plus Premium service. PS3 games still won't be downloadable, streaming will most likely still be crap and won't be improved any time soon, and there'll be a lack of 1st party games (which is honestly what I prefer, but others will understandably argue against it). 

The addition of PS5 games will help a lot, but people who weren't interested in PS Now previously, most likely won't be after either (excluding everyone who's converting to years of PS Plus Premium for a few quid lol)"

PS5,ula7na,Can anyone comment on the 3D audio performance of the Pulse and Arctis 7P?,"I'm pretty interested in the PS5's 3D audio feature. I've been comparing headphones, and it seems like the general consensus is that the Arctis is better for almost everything (comfort, build quality, sound). But I can't find any reviews or comments compare the 3D audio feature for the headphones or say that one has better 3D over the other. Has anyone who has tried both noticed any difference in the 3D audio?

I've also read that apparently any headphones will have 3D audio for PS5, but I have a decent pair of Sennheiser headphones for music that I plug into the 3.5mm jack on the controller, but I don't notice anything special. It just sounds like regular old stereo, and I can really only distinguish either left or right, nothing for behind or in front. I have the 3d audio option on in the settings menu, and I've tried out the various customization settings. Is 3D audio just marketing hype?

Thanks!"

PS5,ul6yh3,The Last of Us 2,"I finished this game probably a few months ago and I was reading some reviews and interpretations of the game, and I came to discover that I seem to be in the minority. I loved the Last of Us. The storytelling is fantastic, the gameplay is beautiful, and the world immersive. If given a choice at the end, to sacrifice Ellie or to save her, then I would choose to save her every time! If I was stuck in an apocalyptic environment like their world, and the only semblance of joy in life was a relationship rekindled by and with a child, then I would never let that go, not for the whole world. The Last of Us 2 presented a very reasonable series of consequences for Joel’s choice in the first game, but I just can’t seem to care or root for Abby. I don’t support her or anything about she tries to accomplish. I understand that the writer’s intention was to display the cycle of violence and voracious appetite of vengeance, but as an audience member of the first game, I was essentially born into the family of Joel and Ellie. Seeing my cherished characters suffer at the hands of a stranger, and then being forced to sympathize with that stranger left me with distaste. Even if it meant destroying hundreds of others’ lives, I would never sacrifice my family for a potential cure to the plague. I would choose violence every time. 

What are your thoughts?"

PS5,uk54yh,"Are PS5 Discs Getting Thinner? Certain discs not ejecting, probable cause?","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a bit of a weird question, but I'm having trouble ejecting game discs from my PS5. But the catch is that they're only certain ones and that they're fairly new releases.  


I had an issue a couple weeks ago where FNAF Security Breach wouldn't eject from my console. After many a struggles and confusion from the Playstation support article (and having to eventually grab a second, flatheaded, screwdriver) I was able to get it out. Got everything working fine, put in a couple other games (F1 2021 and Spider Man Miles Morales to be precise) to see if the issue was fixed. Seemed to be fixed, no problem. Neither game had issues ejecting.  


Flash forward to tonight and I'm wanting to play F1 2021. So I go to eject the game that was in the disc drive - which was Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga. Same issue happened with that game as with FNAF a couple weeks back. Well no problem, I just do what I did a couple weeks ago, and it comes out fine. Again I try putting F1 2021 in and ejecting it out to see if my problem has been fixed. It looks like it has because F1 2021 comes out fine.   


For the heck of it, I put Skywalker Saga back in and try to eject it again, only to have a worse issue trying to eject it than I did the first time where I just hear a cranking noise, as if the screw to manually remove the disc was being used. I quick turn off my system and get it so that I can get the game out, and I do, fine and all. So then I get everything working again and try Spider Man again, and it comes out fine.  


So at this point I take out Spider Man and compare it to the Skywalker Saga, and I'm not sure if it's just me, but it almost seems like the Skywalker Saga disc is just a tad bit thinner than the Spider Man disc. Could this be causing any potential issues for disc ejection on the PS5? Or are the discs the same size and I'm just losing my mind?  


TL;DR - Certain discs won't eject from PS5, they *appear* to be thinner. Are they? If so, is that what's causing an issue?"

It's due to bandwidth limitations forcing the ps5 into YCbCr422. As of now I'm unsure if there's more to it such as audio downgrades etc BUT Sony said a while back (I believe on Twitter?) that when/if the HDMI bandwidth became an issue it would or could be fixed. 
Can anyone add to this anything more recently said or indications of time frame or if maybe it can't really be done? RN even 4k120 hdr forces the system to lose image quality without VRR even, never mind that 8k tag on the ps5 📦 🙄
I picked a good tv JUST for HDMI 2.1 gaming on a set that can support chroma 444, 4k120hdr, local dimming, VRR/freesync, motion enhancement, and game mode almost All at the SAME time, to not be able to on ps5.
Please keep this discussion clean. I would love to hear good technical points of view, especially if anyone knows what hdmi chipset the ps5 uses (Mediatek?)"

PS5,ujnwiy,PS5 controller life,"I had a PS3 and PS4. With both systems, the controllers lasted maybe a year if used daily. The PS5 controller is rated to last 4-8 months when used daily. Not bad as this is like the other playstation controllers. I bought a Xbox X to have access to the games there and found that the Xbox X/S controller - Xbox one too - last a DECADE! This is huge for me as buying controllers gets expensive!"
PS5,ujnw32,What are some games you have tried to get into multiple times but they just didn’t click for you?,"I have a few. Lots of words inbound. 

1.	Dying Light, 3 tries. Furthest I’ve made it was to the 3 air drops or some shit. Something about this game’s graphics that I just hate. Maybe it’s the motion blur or something but I can’t stand it. I also simply don’t like how underpowered you feel and that the only way to deal with zombies is to run away. Yeah the parkour is cool but I play a zombie game to play with zombies not run around them and ignore them completely. And even when you do fight them, using wooden sticks and a pipe while standing on a car is boring. There’s a mission early on where you have to beat up some human enemies that stole medicine or some shit. You are so underpowered at this stage that the ONLY way to fight all 7 of them and not immediately die is to run in, punch one of them one or two times, get your ass beat within an inch of your life, run away to regen health, then rinse and repeat until they’re all dead. Also the controls layout is super obtuse. People keep telling me to stick with it but I can’t make it more than a few hours before getting bored. 
2.	Death Stranding, 2 tries. Furthest I’ve made it was to the first time you have to steal back stuff from the orange guys I don’t remember what they’re called. This makes me sad because I REALLY want to like this game; I enjoy the premise and taking a break from those non-stop action games sounds great but I really hate how the first few hours are basically 95% cutscene and 4% reading about the game and how it works. I know that’s par for the course with Kojima but still. I enjoy navigating the terrain and the online stuff but it’s just information overload with how much text pops up in your screen before, during, and after every single delivery and the game makes no effort to explain anything to you other than basic gameplay and even then it does a horrible job. There’s a part in the beginning where it starts to rain and by this point you know that rain is bad so you want to hide from it. During this delivery, the game very deliberately puts a small cave directly in your path seemingly for you to hide in. “Great,” you think. “I’ll just wait here for a bit for the rain to stop.” WRONG. Turns out that this rain is scripted and will not stop until you keep going and rain does not become a dynamic part of the game until much later. I learned this after sitting in that cave and doing literally nothing for 2 hours while waiting for the rain to stop and upon googling, turns out MANY people did this as well. Not a great start. The UI is a mess and packed with information that’s difficult to parse. And the acting/script is just bad. Very bad. Maybe this was acceptable years ago but we’re in a post TLOU, GoW era of gaming. Shitty acting and mediocre dialogue in a top-tier AAA game is just not acceptable anymore ESPECIALLY in a game that has the cast that DS does. 
3.	Final Fantasy 15, 3 tries. Furthest I got was to the boat/beach after fixing the car. I’m not an FF guy and 15 was the first one I ever played. This shit sucks. How fucking lame is it that you can’t drive the car and it’s on-rails? The combat feels so outdated and… airy? It feels like you’re hitting enemies with a feather and they hardly even react to what you do to them. Magic feels like ass, the AI for enemies and your homies doesn’t do shit, the quests are boring as hell. Dialogue and acting is just horrendous. I realize again this is typical for these games but somehow FF7 Remake is exactly the same but still manages to be miles better in this regard? That game I didn’t finish but that’s because I got distracted with TLOU2 and I’ve been meaning to go back to it. 
4.	Horizon Zero Dawn, furthest I got was about 2-3 hours in. Let me start by saying the game itself isn’t bad. What I don’t like about it is the Ubisoft-style open world. I HATE games that litter your map with a bunch of shit to do. If Elden Ring had done this I would not have played it but it didn’t and that simple change makes exploring and doing quests so much more gratifying. I just can’t stand a game that throws a bunch of what are basically checkboxes for you to do and doesn’t let you organically discover them or complete quests, again like Elden Ring. I also hate games that force you to forage for crafting materials to make weapons and ammo types and all that and HZD does exactly this. Again, Elden Ring is the gold standard here. You don’t NEED to do it but if you want to, just walk over to the thing and press triangle and that’s it. No long ass animation, no 2-3 dialogue boxes to get through, no annoying sounds or anything, just press the button and get the thing. It’s funny because my GF just beat this game and she loves it. I can’t bring myself to play it, it feels like a chore. Which sucks because it looks beautiful and the gameplay itself is superb. It’s everything else leading up to the gameplay that I don’t like. 
5.	Red Dead Redemption 2, 2 tries. Furthest I got was  rescuing that one dude from the small prison somewhere in Valentine? This game man, I just can’t. I can’t play it. Your dude feels so HEAVY and slow to do anything. That’s literally the only thing that stops me. I can’t stand taking 3 years just to turn around or get on your horse or harvest a deer you just killed or loot a building or dead body. I can’t do it. I realize that’s the appeal of the game, the immersion and the slow pace and all that but for me, it doesn’t work. I wish this game had an “impatient mode” where it would just cut out all those animations and deliberate wait times and just instantly do the thing. Then I’d be able to play it. Other than that, 10/10 for everything else. I really want to experience the seemingly amazing story but I cannot bring myself to wait for the hours of animations to get there. 
6.	Warzone. These types of games are lame without friends and I don’t have a consistent squad. And trying communicate with people in pubs is just a horrible experience. People are either rude, annoying, bad teammates, or shit at the game. I’ve not had 1 single positive experience playing with randoms. I really want to play this and be into Warzone but again all my friends are on Fortnite and while I enjoy that too, sometimes I want a different BR experience. Side note: Fortnite no-build more is actually amazing. 

That’s everything. I’m bored at work so yeah lol what do y’all think? What games have you tried to play that just didn’t work for you?"
PS5,ujn4db,I honestly give up (ps5 stock),"I am sorry to complain in this community.

I've been waiting four years to get the PS5. In 2018, I really wanted the playstation 4, seeing this amazing exclusive games, I suddenly heard rumors for a Playstation 5 release in 2 years time. At that moment I knew I should just save up cash for ps5 instead. After 4 years, 2020 I was not able to get into pre order due to the study i had in those last few important months in 2020. In 2021, I decided to get the ps5, but after months of searching and searching. I got into the waitlist on November 2021, and now I really regretted of not getting the ps4. Over 14000 people is inside the waitlist. Now they are giving people in 2021 early Feburary at this moment. I'm in a small country so games doesn't sell well here. I was thinking of buying from scalpers honestly, I'm so fricking late to get the ps5. I want to know if you guys have any other good solution to get ps5 other than scalpers"
PS5,ujn360,"anyone know if you can get a ""ps5"" controller with a ps4 controller shell",I dont like the ergonomics of the new controller I have tried to like the new ps5 controller for like 3 months but still hate it I only play ps4 games at the moment because of that.

So finally with Ps5 my wife gifted me a copy of Elden Ring . My first reaction fuck she wasted 60 Dollars .. but since I didn't want to disappoint her I started playing...died like 50 times to Tree Sentinel but surprisingly I didn't feel frustrated..why because as soon as I died the game had no loading ..back to action.. This changed everything for me ..3 weeks later today I have Platiumed Elden Ring and Bloodborne (including DLC  I defeated Orphan of Kos an hour ago)  ... bought Nioh Remastered Collection and will be buying Dark Souls Trilogy in future  

Thank You  Mark Cerny you beautiful bastard for working your magic on those SSD .. I feel so stupid ignoring entire genre of games ..I feel like a new man.

TLDR ..Faster Loading made me a good souls player 🙏"

PS5,ujfi15,Dualsense on pc,"So I recently got a dualsense and decided to use it on my pc for gaming. I downloaded DS4 Windows and it paired and worked. The vibrations were like normal vibrations, like if I hit or shoot something it'll vibrate. However when I plugged it into my pc I noticed that my pc automatically switched to the dualsense speakers. Although the sound was low, I could feel the haptics but the sound was very low. I figured out that I could then plug my headphones into the controller to hear the sound and experience the haptics. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but when I plugged it in was it using the actual haptics of the controller rather than the generic rumble? If so which experience did you guys prefer, using it wirelessly with DS4 Windows, or plugging it in without using DS4 Windows at all?"
PS5,uje9t5,Is there a way to download the PS4 version of fifa 22 on the PS5?,I was hoping to play this with a bunch of friends but they all have PS4s and because of that I can’t play with them.
PS5,uje6is,Are variable or “contextual” resolution modes possible?,"When I’m playing Horizon and get into **combat**, I turn on **60fps** and turn off fidelity 4K mode. 

When I’m playing Uncharted Remastered, I play 60fps performance mode, but stop to change all **cinematics** to **4k30fps**.

If feasible, I hope the next step for developers will be providing variable modes for those with the screens that can utilize the enhancement.

However, for some I understand there could be irritation from the switching. Also. some games let you pause to change the resolution and some need a restart, so I’m not sure how much of a challenge this could be. 

Imagine playing Horizon and exploring in 4k30 and then when a combat begins, you go back to the variable4k60fps combat. I’m sure there could even be a “smoothing” when the game knows you are leaving combat for good or may run into encounters again quickly. 

It could help reduce the suddenness of the frame-rate switch. When the games know you’re going to be exploring a town, it’s going to make sure it’s 4k30. If you just left cleared a cave in 1800p/60fps combat, and the next location on your map 100m away isn’t cleared, it might as well not go back to 4K30fps pretty mode until you’re really done with the bad guys in the area. 

For cinematics, I’m surprised this isn’t always an option. I don’t know if any of this would work for open word games, but I wanted to get the idea out there for discussion."

PS5,uj8f21,Do you think there will ever be true user-progression between a game and it's sequel(s)?,"I'll use the Horizon series as an example. Imagine you can import your HZD save data into HFW and it can read what armor, weapons, etc. you had equipped during your last save. Then you start HFW with the same build you had at the end of HZD, even if it's purely cosmetic. It would really feel like you're continuing the same story, playing the same ""version"" of Aloy that you spent all that time with in HZD. I can't be the only one that's sometimes wondered ""why, in this sequel, is the character basically starting back at square 1"" in terms of armor, weapons, skills, etc.

An even deeper idea is if the game is able to tell from the save data which side quests were completed in HZD. Then when meeting the recurring characters in HFW, if you completed their quests in HZD they greet you as an old friend, and if not then they introduce themselves as if they haven't met before. It would really create a unique experience for each individual player based on what they chose to do or not do in the previous game while also making it less immersion-breaking if someone is familiar with the main story but may not have played the first game before jumping into the second. 

Do ya'll think this kind of progression will ever exist? Games can already scan for a different game's save data in general and give items/rewards, so I guess it's more of a question of what data is accessible within the save file itself and if devs can take advantage of that and build it in?"

I honestly think they have done an amazing job of converting a complicated game to console and should be commended for it! It’s my favourite way of playing.

I really hope more people give this gem a try, especially if you like Game of Thrones type medieval intrigue 😁"

How boned am I?,"Just as the title says: For some reason a trophy wasn’t showing up that I was certain I got after a boss fight. I figured I’d just re-do the fight. Downloaded a cloud save without realizing it said 4/5/22 and not 5/5/22 and now I’ve basically hours of progress and roughly 80 lvls. Every other game has recently uploaded to cloud since yesterday. I have no idea why this one hasn’t. I’ve trouble shot and everything is set up as it should be. 

Elden Ring is the only game that has not recently uploaded to the cloud and I’m just extremely upset. Anyone have any idea what happened and what my options are?"

PS5,uimcs9,PS5 Controller Battery Drains Quickly,"Has anyone have had an issue with the general battery charge on the PS5 controllers? I recently bought a PS5 and the controller is new, the box was sealed, everything is brand new, everything’s running the latest OS. I have noticed that a single charge doesn’t last as long as I would have expected.

Now, hear me out ! If I play games that are for PS5 of course the new vibration features, the microphone on, and everything else will drain the battery quickly.

But yesterday, it was fully charged, I muted it, and I was literally just watching something on Netflix, the controller was barely touched for pausing and rewinding, and after three hours I had low battery.

I have only had a PS2 &amp; a PS3, and when I used the PS3 controller the battery lasted for days. I just don’t know if most users at least are having the same issue, or if this is expected or a normal behaviour even maybe on PS4? Idk… should I make use of the warranty?

Thanks ! :)"

PS5,uil23a,So. I apparently know pain.,"I was just asleep this morning when my alarm rang off. It was, however, raining and storming outside so I snoozed my alarm for 20 minutes. 12 minutes in and I heard a snap, like something fell to the ground. It jolted me awake.

It's enough of an inconvenience that I'm complaining about it. 

I don't want to have to go into the menu or pull out a USB dongle that's easy to lose. When I shut off the headset on my series X it doesn't try to keep connecting to it. 

Is anybody else experiencing this? Any advice?"

* Europe – targeting June 22, 2022

Now, we still have ***NO IDEA*** what sort of games will be included in the subscriptions and Sony seems to be **VERY** quiet recently.

If i turn down my game volume it somehow stops it but then of course i can barely hear my game.. turning down the mic sensitivity also fixes it BUT my teamates can then barely hear my voice.. the same headphones work fine on my ps4 and ive also tried another headset and it was still the same problem. ive also read to try turning off 3D sound to fix it, tried that too and nothing changed"

I have a HDD from my PS4, that's a WD Passport 4TB. From what I understand I can easily plug it in to the PS5 and have access to my PS4 games, but what about storing PS5 games on it? 

Do PS5 games only store to SDD? 

If I connect the HDD to the PS5, can I download PS4 games directly to it from the PS Store?

If I was to get a SDD, would it store both PS4 and PS5 games to the same device?

Basically I got the 4TB so I could go all digital with my games esp because of the PS Plus games that drop monthly, I download them whether I play them or not, with now about 100 games on it. I wouldn't mind upgrading to a SDD but I don't want to have to bounce back and forth if I don't have too. Like I said I've done research and get conflicting results with articles that are dated from from the time the PS5 came out and can't seem to find anything about the current status of the HDD/SDD situation so anyone more knowledgeable please chime in.

PS5,uhzp3t,This console generation is lame so far,"I spent 6 months hunting down a PS5 and finally got one in June of 2021. I’m not sure if I was more excited about getting to play with the new toy or if I was relieved to have secured one, thereby allowing me to close the 24-hour alarm youtube feeds, stop scouting for drops, and quit getting my hopes up and destroyed in morale-crushing online shopping carts. I paid 650 for this sucker, but it came from a very secure source so I felt is was worth the price. I have used it every day for the past year almost, and I maintain that 650 I got my money’s worth already. 

I’m in the middle of an It Takes Two playthrough with the wife and it’s a great time. Elden Ring blew my freaking mind, and it was fun being part of the online communities in that zeitgeist. It’s a good time to be a gamer, with whats come out recently and whats in the pipeline. 

But its also been a bit lame and lonesome. All my friends want a PS5 but they have given up over a year ago on going above and beyond to find one. And to be fair, its fucking ridiculous. And paying above MSRP is also a nonstarter for everyone I know. I am effectively the ONLY person I know IRL that has a PS5. Everyone else has moved on to Xbox which is actually attainable or even quit console gaming for PC gaming or other hobbies entirely. Other friends arent excited to play lesser versions of new games on old hardware so they forego new titles to hopefully experience them when they can get a newer console. 

I don’t really care about what the caused the supply shortage, be it covid, scalpers, chips, poor planning. But its been a strange year. It’s both the best time and a very disconnected time to be a gamer for IRL gaming friendships and interactions Ive had for the past 3 decades. 

TL;DR Love my PS5 and the new gen, just wish I could share that excitement with friends and family who have been left behind. Cheers."

Adding innovative new techniques to getting the most performance out of their games, with Fidelity modes in both those games now running at 50fps with VRR and 120hz instead of 30fps when they first came out. And with Performance Ray Tracing mode on Ratchet and Clank now running at an average to 90-100fps even though it's arguably the best looking console game to date.

These people are doing magic and I don't see any other AAA studio right now running at their level, like clockwork consistently pushing the envelope and delivering great games while leading the way in ongoing support of older releases, with zero scandals and complaints from employees."

I know this might sound ridiculous for most people, but for me it makes perfect sense as I don't like replaying games at all and for multiplayer ones I could make an exception and buy them SH if they're PS exclusives (I already got a PC for most competitive gaming).

Currently I have a launch PS5 controller which I bought a back button mod from amazon, but its getting to the point now where its starting to fall apart, ive had to replace the paddles because part of it has snapped off, ive had to constantly clean the analogue areas to stop stick drift and now the spring on my R2 has broke and I'm waiting on a replacement from amazon but I want to look at replacing it now before more stuff starts falling apart."

PS5,uh8s31,LG Oled C1= game changer!!,"I'm pretty sure it's prolly been mentioned before and I know there's an LG oled C2 out as well, but let me just say that I came from playing the ps5 on the following tvs such as a 4k tcl(49in), lg Oled c7(65in), LG Nano cell 90 series(75in), Vizio oled(55in), and lastly an lg Oled C1(48in) and while the vizio oled tv and lg nano cell 90 were really good tvs, what I didn't like about the nano cell was the blooming issues the tv had and the blacks were good just not as good as oled. And vizio was good but there's alot of software issues But the lg oled c1, man oh man the colors are just spot on and the level of details the tv brings out compared to the rest is a massive improvement. I didn't really think it could be that much of a difference in color or detail switching from the vizio oled to the lg c1 but boy was I wrong. You can tell the difference in quality immediately and all the latest gaming features seem to work on this tv for me at least. But I just wanted to say if anyone is looking for a gaming tv just save up and get you an lg oled. The prices for them these days have been to bad. This is the only tv so far where I barley had to change any of the tv settings, everything out of the box is pretty much picture perfect at least to my eyes."

PS5,uh4ki7,So should I just give up and go back to Xbox?,"Hey there, I'm new to the PS community. Really I'm not a part of it, but I was hoping to be. I have never owned a Playstation except the original console way back when. I became a fan of Xbox when it first came out because of titles like Halo and KoToR, games that were exclusive to Xbox at the time and then just kinda stayed with Xbox over the years. However, these days, I find myself playing a lot more titles that have online multiplayer elements where community size matters. And I had no idea that the PS community was 3 times the size of the Xbox. Especially with FromSoftWare titles, two of which, Demon Souls and BloodBorne that I never even got to experience. And damn I wanna own Elden Ring for PS5 over Xbox Series X. What I'm saying is I made the decision I wanna change sides, but is it worth the trouble?

Thing is, I simply can't find a PS5 from a non scumbag source. And I've been told that the PS5 will most likely not become widely available, as in being able to walk into a Best Buy without fear of being sold out, until mid 2023. I was actually told that back in February of 2021 by two different people, which I laughed off at the time, obviously I no longer think its funny. Now I just recently purchased a decent gaming PC, which was a bit pricey. I could maybe afford to buy an Xbox Series X (they are easily available to me), to hold me over awhile longer until the PS5 is more available, but what I cannot do, is afford to then rebuy all the games I purchased for the Xbox, again on the PS5, know what I'm saying? With prices on everything going up like crazy I'm trying to be very careful right now.

So I know I'm kinda talking to myself here and maybe this was a pointless post but I was wondering if anyone was in a similar boat in this logic; is it really worth waiting for the PS5 if it's going to take another year to get here? Like at that time, the system will be going on 3 years dated, when I could buy a Series X tonight, keeping all my microsoft purchase library for all the many titles I have already bought that I never played, which are in the dozens, and just say screw PS, or do you, the members of the PlayStation community think it's truly worth the wait? 

Guys I'm sorry if this comes off as a stupid question that I have already answered myself, that was not worth taking the time to read, I'm just having a hard time right now personally, every little thing is getting to me. I feel obsessed over which console to get, and video games right now are the only thing that takes my mind off of some really heavy shit I'm going through. Is it worth waiting or should I just stay with Xbox and wait for the PS6 instead? Thank you all."

So I love how the PS5 turns on the TV and Receiver when I turn on the PS button on the dual sense controller.

I was really interested in Remote Play from my iPad Pro.  I installed Remote Play, bought an extra dual sense that is only linked to the iPad.

When I link the ipad Pro to the PS5 with remote play, the PS5 goes from rest to on mode.  I understand that this is normal.  What I don't like is that the HDMI link activates the TV and receiver.

Is there a way to have HDMI link turn the TV and Receiver only when using normal play? (So that using Remote Play does not turn on the TV and Receiver?)

But to my surprise, no matter what I did, it wouldn't let me checkout (not a stock issue, but rather a payment issue..read more in my previous post)

I contacted SONY, they looked into it and a few days later they sent me an exclusive invite to buy a PS5 on Wednesday between 3-8PM. I made sure everything was in order and even asked 2 good friends to stand by with their credit cards as backup. I got to the checkout again and received the same error. I thought no worries, I have friends helping me. So I asked friend #1 to use his credit card. We tried it 2 times and both times it placed a hold on his funds but no checkout. I then called friend #2. We did same thing, again payment error. I stopped and figured we tried too many times. 3 days later I tried again with another card to buy another item from the store and again payment was declined. I contacted SONY, they looked into it and again invited me to buy a PS5 on Wednesday. But no matter what I do. No matter who I contact. No one seems to be able to fix this issue. I have read that more people have similar issues and I think its just unfair to loyal customers. A company this big should have phone support or at least offer more payment options like paypal for instance. By the bare minimum they should have someone explaining what is going on."

PS5,ugqmbt,Is there a way to get Chinese audio on Cyberpunk?,"I borrowed the Cyberpunk disc from a friend of mine (it came from Indian Amazon) because I wanted to practice my Chinese while I went home on summer break. I had the idea because I'd been using Cyberpunk on PC and it had full Chinese dialogue on it. But when I opened it on PS5, the only options were English and two unrelated European languages.

Is there a way to get Chinese dialogue on it? Or do I have to buy the Asian editions somehow?

Please let me know thanks :) I'd really appreciate it."

Lots of people in the comments of the original playstation blog post asking for Freesync support and stil a lot of people are asking for 1440p support. I don’t know why Sony has trouble communicating to us that they hear us and if they’re going to fix or add what the community wants. A large amount of people with gaming monitors have freesync only, and a lot of people have 1440p monitors. I don’t know why it’s popular to purposely leave out people just because they can. That’s not even right."

Back when FFXIV first came to PS4 I registered for a free trial, hardly played it but that username is linked to my PSN ID. Recently I thought i would give it a go after hearing great things and downloaded it on the PS5. The issue is when I load it up for a free trial my previous account is still linked and won’t let me log in with new credentials (not even giving me the option for enter a new username). 

The only way I can do a free trial is to use a different user on the PS, not ideal. Do you know if there is any way to unlink my main PSN to that old Square Enix account. I have obviously tried contacting them to no avail."

PS5,ugj23r,"Embracer Group enters into an agreement to acquire Eidos, Crystal Dynamics, and Square Enix Montréal amongst other assets", 
PS5,ugizlp,"Upgrading your existing PS4 library to PS5 is a nightmare, and I really wish I was warned about it beforehand.","So I finally got my PS5 today along with a 2TB M.2 drive, and I couldn't be less satisfied with my purchase. And it all comes down to the absolute nightmare that is upgrading your PS4 games to PS5 versions, as well as continuing your saves on the performance enhanced PS5 versions of these games I was previously playing on PS4. 

Here are all the different variations I've ran into so far when it came to trying to boot my old PS4 saves on the PS5 versions of applications. 

1. (Paying more than the base cost of the PS5 game. Eg.: FFVIIR) - The upgrade to the base game is free, but you have to buy the content that comes with the PS5 version separately. And it's twenty dollars, which means you pay $80 for a $70 game if you bought it on PS4 originally

2. (Have to download both PS4 and PS5 app. Eg.:FFXIV, FFVIIR, Spider-Man) - You have to download both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game to your PS5 to transfer your save/settings over. Even though I transferred the save data over directly from my PS4 to my PS5 using the Data Transfer feature, I still have to manually boot the PS4 version of the above games to convert the PS4 save data into PS5 data. For certain games, PS4 save data can only be converted to PS5 save data WITHIN the PS4 version of the app. Meaning you have to download the same 80GB~ game twice just to be able to continue the save on the PS5. 

3. (Trophy Progress does not transfer even though your save does. Eg.: Elden Ring and GT7) - Game save will automatically convert which is great, but trophy progress between the PS4 and PS5 version isn't synced. If I play the PS4 version of Elden Ring on PS5, my trophies carry over. But if I continue my PS4 save on PS5, none of my trophies carry over. Which means I won't be able to get a platinum unless I kill all those bosses I got trophies for in a new game or New Game+. Haven't yet looked to see if any trophies I previously received in GT7 are now locked out due to my Dave's progress)

4. (Spider-Man. Just... Spider-Man) - This one is NUTS. And I haven't completely figured it out yet. But I can't upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from in the PS4 version of the app. And there's no purchasable upgrade within the PlayStation store. Apparently you need to buy Mile Morales Ultimate Edition to get the upgrade. And then you upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from the MILES MORALES APPLICATION. Wut???

5. Cyberpunk 2077 - Haven't finished downloading the app yet, but apparently you literally need to do nothing. Just download the PS5 version and your PS4 save is there. Trophy list carries over too from what I've seen. Completely baffled as to why this game with one of the shoddiest launches ever seems to have their version upgrade process down pat. 

So every game seems to work differently, and there's no guidance on any of it at all. You just boot a game and find out if you're lucky. And if you're not, it's to Google you go to see how/if you can bring you PS4 saves/trophies to the PS5 version of the game.

This to me is beyond unacceptable. I've been hearing about Xbox's smart delivery and how you just boot the game you want up and you saves are there and everything is optimized as needed and the buyers remorse I currently have is huge. I bought a PS5 for FFXVI/FFVIIR and because I had this massive digital library on my PlayStation 4 I wanted to hold onto, and right now I feel like I've been–due to those two things–forced onto a platform I really want nothing to do with. 

Anyway, I know this is very ranty for an r/games post. But I think these examples are very important for potential buyers to be aware of, and I know if I saw a post like this, I would have held off on upgrading to the PS5. So hoping this stays up for others to see."

PS5,ug1sxy,I don't regret buying a digital PS5,"I purchased a digital version for my girlfriend, and recently I obtained a digital version for myself. The digital version is much sleeker, lighter, and it looks so much nicer standing up than the fat, bulky original one. It feels at least 2lbs lighter, and is much easier to move around and take apart when inserting an SSD, just due to how much thinner and lighter it is.

&amp;#x200B;

And aesthetically speaking, it just looks so nice a trimmed down compared to the disc version - with the fat protrusion jetting out from its side. This post is my own personal experience to counter the popular ""I regret buying a digital PS5"" thread on the homepage right now. Aside from not being able to purchase physical discs (if that's important to you), every other aspect to the digital PS5 is a positive compared to the bulky disc version."

PS5,ufv81g,I regret buying a digital PS5,"I got my digital PS5 in February 2021. Why did I go digital? Because I noticed that I would buy nearly all of my games on the PSN store when they were on deep discount. I'm patient with games, I can wait.

However, lately I've been having the itch to play newer games. I wanted to wait till Horizon: FW got a price drop but was anxious to play it and thought ""do I want to wait 6 months to save €20"" and just bought it for €80 (here in Germany). Then I looked and found that you can buy it on disc for as little €35.

I think the digital PS5 would be fine for people who don't need the newest titles, or just have a shit load of money to burn. But having the games on disc means I can get newer titles much cheaper and can sell them afterwards if you don't plan on replaying them anytime soon. Hell, even if you want to replay something a few years later they'll be super cheap.

Does anyone else have regrets? Has anyone else sold their digital PS5 to buy the disc one?"

In ps store every single add on says installed, so I cannot start the download there. In the ps mobile app the is a button to start the download, but pressing it does not start the download.

In game it says not installed

For me reinstalling the game did not help. Tried both installing from disc and digital version. Under manage game contents I cannot delete the dlc as some video tutorials suggets.

For a third reinstall I used the GOTY edition. The download size was larger, but the outcome was the same. DLC still not working.

More recently it has been disconnecting from every controller, including the remote, when I boot it up. It won't be able to reconnect the controllers, even with the cable, until the PlayStation has been restarted. It doesn't happen all of the time but more often when I haven't played in a couple days/weeks."

PS5,uf01em,PS5 Ethernet Port: Who's else is starting to go?,"So the title has it all. After about 6-7 months of using my Ethernet cable a lot more between my PS5 and laptop it is having connection issues. I know it's the PS5 port because it works with the laptop and wiggling it makes it works sometimes.

I know Sony used cheap ports on the PS4 but was surprised the same problem is still here. I even called a repair shop to get an estimate on how much it would be but they told me the part isn't even available to buy from China. So they recommend to RMA it through Sony but I know that is a shitshow and the PS5 is gone for a long time.


Anyone else having these problems or seen them around? Any permanent fixes for it? Any help would be appreciated 👍"
PS5,uez3p8,PS5 is having disc drive problems,"I have a day 1 PS5 with disc drive that has been well taken care of. One day for no reason when I ejected my game the disc itself comes all the way out, instead of mostly out so you can take the disc. I have to literally press eject and then hold my hands under the disc slot to catch the disc as it comes all the way out and falls into my hands.
Then the system continues to try and eject nothing at this point while making very loud ejection sounds. It does this cycle 4 times and then it's done. At this point I can not insert another disc. If I try it does nothing.
I learned if I press eject,  catch the disc, then lightly tap on the side of my PS5 disc drive ( maybe 5 to 10 light taps) it will stop its ejection thing its doing right away. Instead of its cycle of 4. As I am tapping on its side I listen for a light click sound. When I hear that it will allow me to insert another disc and play like normal.
This is a process I have to repeat everytime I want to play a different game.
Any help or ideas?
I have not taken the system apart yet. Hoping it's a simple fix if I do.
Sony was supposed to send me a box to it in for repairs at 14 months ( thank you to Reddit for saying Sony was still accepting warranty repairs after a year) but it didn't show up and when I got in touch again Sony wanted money.
Hope this makes some sense..."

My ideal use case is emotes in games like *Elden Ring* and *Dark Souls III*! Just a quick swipe with your thumb or index finger over the touchpad and voila, wave emote triggers. It doesn't even need a button press.

Is it too complex to implement?

Does it require too much cpu which is needed elsewhere?

Or maybe there **is** a button press or touchpad press needed to register in the system?"

PS5,uebf8w,Turn off Activity Cards,"I've found a Frankenstein approach to turn off the Activity Cards. If you do the following, it should remove the cards and stop them from appearing as far as I can tell:

Under Settings:
- Notifications &gt; Games That Notify You &gt; manually unfollow each game
- Captures and Broadcasts &gt; Auto-Captures &gt; Trophies/Challenges &gt; select none or turn off Auto-Capture feature for both trophies and challenges

On the cards itself:
- Pro Tip Card &gt; Select 'Options' and select dismiss
- Any existing Trophy/Challenge cards &gt; select to open all captures and delete them

Now, this approach will mean no new videos of trophies or challenges are collected and your old ones are deleted, but you won't see any cards - so if your goal is no activity cards at all, this should do it. I called PS to confirm this would be a good approach and they actually took down MY notes to help other players in the future.

Cheers!"

PS5,ue3vjj,Likelihood of Freesync support being added?,"It's my current understanding that only 13 monitors on the market currently support PS5 VRR. This is absolutely ridiculous: the cheapest monitors on the list all cost more than the PS5 itself. Why should I spend 600+ on a new monitor when my $200 monitor is completely capable of Freesync and the PS5 has an AMD chipset?

I'm legitimately considering getting the cheapest m32u as soon as i can afford it, but when that's more expensive than  a new XSX (which does support Freesync), why would I get a marginal upgrade to my display when I just get a more fully featured console that uses my current display better?


All that being said, it seems not only anticonsumer, but actually kinda stupid of Sony to not enable Freesync. I was not seriously considering an XSX before this half-baked VRR update, but now Sony has given MS a great advertisement. Of the more advanced users that care about VRR, how many of them are gonna shell out 600+ for the new display instead of just a new console for less? And this is all assuming that these monitors don't start getting scalped. There is very little selection and supply of these PS5 vrr compatible monitors, and since almost anything related to the PS5 gets scalped at some point, I would not be surprised to see cheaper units like the M28U, M32U, and the XB283K start selling out.

All of this being said, I think there is at least a chance that Sony eventually adds Freesync support. It doesn't seem likely (one would hope they would have realized how few monitors are supported and just included Freesync in the latest update, if not earlier in the consoles life cycle), but considering how this just suggests to customers to get an Xbox instead of a new display, I would hope that Sony reconsiders. What do yall think?"

PS5,udpn0f,Dualsense touchpad issues,"I can't seem to find any clear info on this issue, especially on how to resolve it, so if anyone has seen another post about this please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to give a detailed explanation of the problem:

Whenever I've used the touchpad button input a few times the motion controls and touch input seem to malfunction. 

**General ps5 interface;** When typing something the cursor gets stuck when in the motion control mode of the keyboard. 

**Game examples;** In Ghostwire Tokyo you can used swiping on the touchpad to switch between 'weapons' and in other instances in the game you need to paint a symbol by swiping on the touchpad, but after having used the button of the touchpad this starts to act erratically. 

Another good example is GTA online, you have to hold the touchpad button to open the frequently used quick menu, but this messes with the weapon wheel or radio wheel to the point where even the stick input doesn't work to switch weapons or radio stations. It also messes with the ingame webbrowser used to access a multitude of services, the cursor keeps popping back into the upper left corner when you try to move it with the touchpad or stick.

&amp;#x200B;

**Temporary fix;** When I restart the controller it seems to fix the problem until I start pressing the touchpad button again. I've also tried compleatly resetting the controler but it just gives the same result.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to exchange my controller once before because a spring broke in one of the triggers, but both controllers have had this same issue. I've only recently started playing games that make more use of the touchpad and it's really quite annoying, especially in GTA Online (just tried to get back into that game and there are other reasons that reminded me why I quit in the first place, but having to turn my controller off and on again so often does not help either).

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows how to fix this more permanently or if it's just a bad controler and I need to go back to the store, please let me know."

PS5,ud9od4,VRR is already live, 
PS5,ud9kbu,120hz/VRR is absolute game changer for fidelity modes and should be implemented industry wide. No more compromising frame rates when choosing quality.,"Playing Miles Morales this morning with 120hz/VRR on and it runs at a smooth 50fps with zero screen tearing or any visible frame drops for me it's indistinguishable from 60fps, all achieved with no resolution or quality hit at all. 

I know these features are still on the higher end side but in a few years they'll be standard in TVs just like 4k became."

I ended up buying a new controller because I thought mine might be broken but the new controller is having the same issues with connecting. Strangely it will also seem to have a fine connection and no drift or strange issues but then a second later will have the problems. I'm not sure what to do as I haven't found much for this issue through Google or anything. Any help or tips would be appreciated."

PS5,ud46y6,how to get VRR to work on ps5,"so I was reading on reddit that some people had the VRR on their system already. So I went to check my ps5 and surely enough I did not see that option and yes my system was connected to the internet om rest mode and I did restart my system also as I read some comments had said to do so and the VRR option still did not show up. So what I did was go to settings, I then clicked on ""system"", afterwards I clicked on ""system software"" and scrolled down and clicked on ""System Feauture Updates"" and it said ""please wait"" and I was then greeted with a message saying ""the latest version of all system features are installed"", so I went back to check under the screen and video options tab and now I was able to see the New VRR option tab, so hope this helps if anyone turns on their system and doesn't see the new VRR option right away."

This morning I downloaded the patch for Miles Morales that enables 120hz mode and VRR, and I have to say it’s excellent.

When properly enabled it sets the games quality mode to 40fps, and then with VRR it allows the game to go above 40fps when able without any issues.

Imo it’s a game changer (pun intended)."

PS5,ucxyf6,"Is it just me, or are the side plates extremely tight and hard to put back into place?","When I first tried to take off the top-facing side plate on my PS5, it was extremely difficult. I used the correct method, which is to pull the corner with the PS Logo up and slide down, while bracing the bottom of the console, however it still took a considerable amount of force, and the hooks on the plate left some superficial scratches on the black part of the console when it finally came off. Furthermore, I cannot fully attach the plate back onto the PS5, as the two circular hooks to the left and right of the PS logo will not go into place for whatever reason, no matter how hard I try to align the plate or how much force I apply while pushing it."
PS5,ucxu7e,Rest Mode Charging Issues,"Hi!
I recently bought a brand new Ps5 (finally!!).
It's amazing, but there is a problem.
When I try to put the console in rest mode and try to connect the dual Sense or the headset (Platinum wireless headset from Sony) on the front USB port to charge them, they don't actually charge. 
I checked the system options and verified that the USB port alimentation on rest mode is on (is set to ""Always"") but nothing changed.
The system has the most recent update and the charge when the console is powered on (not in rest mode) gives no problems.
It's a common problem of the ps5 or I bought a faulty one? 
Thanks for the answers."

Those with capable displays can now enjoy the highest fidelity settings without compromising frame rates."
PS5,ucwa98,Has anyone used the Steel Series Arctis 7p+?,"I recently bought these from Walmart and I have to say I am severely disappointed. There are no highs, no lows, and the mic picked up my friend through our voice chat and he could hear himself through my mic, even after turning down the sensitivity all the way in the PS5 settings. Between that and the awful soundstage of this headset, I can't see why anyone would recommend or even buy these.

PS5,ucw57k,VRR works with HDMI switches and TCL 50S546,TCL 50S546 $429 on sale VRR Supported I also tried it on the Xbox Series X works perfect as well.
PS5,ucw3bc,"Sony dropped the ball with this VRR release. Only goes down to 48hz, when Series X goes down to 30hz. This needs to be worked out.","This means games like Elden Ring won't benefit as much on PS5 as they would on Series X as frame rates below 48 will not benefit from VRR. 

I don't understand why they would hype this feature so much and nerf it. I suspect it's due to the fact Sony TVs don't support VRR lower than the 48hz range. 

This is a terrible reason to release a feature and nerf it compared to your competition."
PS5,ucvy4e,Speakers for PS5,"Hi all,  noob question. what are the recommendations for speakers for PS5?

Currently i'm running e25hd through soundblaster G6 (usb). Music and movie wise it's ok. But when it comes to gaming, the sounds are quite muddied/drone-y around the low to mid range. i'm not sure whether it's my speaker issue or my ears (i find the e25hd exceptionally warm thus used the g6 to tune the response)... the current game i'm engrossed in is GT7....."
PS5,ucvy36,Why cap the PS5 VRR range at 48hz+? Is it because Sony TVs have that range. This makes no sense for most supported displays,"The most popular LG OLEDs support 40hz+ range, why cap the PS5 at 48hz+? This means fidelity modes in most games won't even be boosted with VRR as much as they could be if this artificial cap wasn't placed on the VRR support. 

This is disappointing after the long wait seeing as the main feature I was excited about it being able to play in quality mode setting with higher frame rates without compromising on fidelity."
PS5,ucvtp0,Game recommendation that you finished,"I have downloaded and played tons of games and the only games I actually loved and finished are Red Dead 2, the last of Us 2, uncharted, life is strange, and it takes two. Would love to see more good game recommendations, thx!"
PS5,ucvqyv,VRR is live now - Running Elden Ring in VRR,"Okay, probably most of you have already seen video from Vincent (HDTVTest) on YouTube in VRR alreay being enabled in PS5. I checked whether VRR is available in settings or not and to my surprise it was there without any update. Ford up couple of games to check if this was indeed working on my LG CX and it is definitely working. I know HDMI 2.1 is not super common, but it's a start and maybe Sony would roll it out for 2.0 as well in near future.

I'm really excited to try out Elden Ring on my PS5 now."
PS5,ucvh03,"Please explain VRR to me, in really dumbed down terms.","So I'm not big on tech. I've heard decent things about this VRR thing. I haven't tried it on my Series X, but might with my PS5. What exactly does it do?

I'm here thinking it's gonna make framerates better. I have a 120hz Sony tv that can do VRR. So will it make the game seem as if it's running that high? I'd like to know what it can do."
PS5,ucvcdv,So does VRR/120hz mark the beginning of the end of 30fps on consoles?,It seems like 30fps is becoming a thing of the past. Even in quality mode it seems these games can now push 40-50fps with the help of 120hz/VRR.
PS5,ucv6q1,So can someone explain the VRR/120hz magic to me?,"I'm meeting frame rates of 100-110FPS on high fidelity games like Spider Man and Ratchet and Clank when without VRR thee systems would probably need to run these games at 720p to achieve those kinds of FPS results. 

How is VRR increasing performance by this much and is it that the TV itself is handling the brunt of the performance?"
PS5,ucv4n1,"Havent received VRR yet (Im in Asia), or is my HDMI not compatible?","My HDMI is a Vention ‘Hdmi 2.1’ (or so they said) which I bought because of the longer length than sony’s. This hdmi has ‘ultra high speed’ label on the body.

PS5,ucpxvn,PSA Regarding VRR and Fidelity Modes,"Unfortunately, It appears that the PS5 is limited to a 48-120hz VRR range even if your TV or monitor supports 20-120hz. This means that VRR is limited to frame rates of 48fps and higher. Fidelity Modes that cap frames at 30 or 40 frames per second will not benefit from VRR as it will not be engaged despite your TV telling you that it’s enabled.  

This can be shown by paying attention to the refresh rate on whatever info dialog your TV shows. When VRR is working between 48hz-120hz you will see the refresh rate fluctuating. When VRR disengages it will cap itself to the fresh rate of the panel (my C1 shows 119 when playing 30fps modes for example) and provide no benefit despite stating that it’s enabled. Reason being is the TV does technically recognize it as being enabled but if it falls out of it’s allowed range it disengages and waits for the frame rate to fall back in range so it can re-engage VRR.  

Not sure if it’s a hardware limitation or something that can be patched through firmware, but if you want to take advantage of VRR you’ll need to be playing on the various performance modes that allow for 60+ frames. On the bright side uncapped performance modes are feeling great and people seem to be reported that games like Elden Rings performance mode feels much smoother."

All I want to do is stream PS5 play on Twitch while having my PS5 hooked up to one of my computer monitors. Do I need the adapter or is that just if I was playing PSVR? Or do I actually have to buy the PS5 camera? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."

PS5,ucnmac,I think vrr bricked my ps5,"I was testing out vrr and so I booted up Fortnite to see the 120fps vrr. I started getting graphical glitches immediately. I closed out of the game and now I get those same stutters and graphical glitches on every game. I disabled vrr, rebooted my ps5, and unplugged both the power and hdmi cords to no avail. It is not my TV because it works fine with everything else. Any ideas?"
PS5,ucmshy,Just got a PS5 - suggestions for games?,"i finally got to order a PS5, and its coming soon. I haven't played on a playstation for a while,. and i was wondering what exclusives i should look into...

I love single player story oriented games, like spider-man, god of war, and the horizon series. stuff i can really get lost in, if that makes sense. I hate stuff that is stupid difficult like souls games.

any suggestions? I want to take advantage of this, and get to play stuff i don't have access to through steam. thanks!"
PS5,ucm4y5,"Ride 4 for PS5 with the season pass is on sale on PSN. It’s an AMAZING racing game, and the best playing and best looking motorcycle racing game I’ve ever played.","Make sure that you get the PS5 version. The PS4 and PS5 versions are totally different games and there is no free upgrade. 

If you wanna know if it’s worth it to get the season pass, I think so. It cuts the grind down to zero by letting you get double credits and gives a bunch of bikes to get you started. If you prefer the grind you can buy the season pass afterwards for slightly more money if you chase your mind. 

This is my favorite game on PS5 right now. It has the best use of the dual sense controller of any PS5 game. Yes, I know what I’m saying, it’s better than Astro. You can feel the rear wheel about to slide out from under you as you accelerate through turns. You can feel the wheels coming very close to locking up as you brake. It provides such amazing feedback I believe that gamers on other platforms would be at a huge disadvantage if there was cross play."
PS5,uclnp1,PSA for enabling VRR on your LG OLED TVs,"1) Ensure you’ve connected the factory HDMI (2.1) or any other supporting 2.1 HDMI to your TV

2) Turn on Instant Game Response, Deep Colour Output and Freesync in your Picture Settings

3) Go to PS5 settings -&gt; Screen -&gt; VRR and toggle it off and turn back to Automatic

4) Enable the unsupported games toggle as well

5) Launch a game and once it has booted, press the green button on your TV remote a couple of times (press repeatedly) until a popup appears on your screen

6) In the Popup if it says “Fixed” then your VRR is not on, if it says VRR and shows you the live fps, then VRR is working for you!

Try out the above steps and let me know in case you face any hiccups, cheers!"

PS5,ucir3g,Cant play online - Wifi without Password,"I need help quickly!
Im in a hotel, that has wifi without any safety (no Password and NO BROWSER LOGIN) at all, at the moment.
I can connect to it, download games and play GTA Online (example). 

But as soon as i want to join a public lobby there or start any other online game, i receive connection troubles.

In UFC 4 for example, it shows me, that there is a problem with my PSN-connection. When i check it at settings it has no connection issues at all…

Is this because of the missing safety feature and does anyone know any solution for this

REMEMBER: I dont have the typical Hotel Wifi problem (i dont need to login at a browser at all!!)"
PS5,uciatf,Cyberpunk 2077 Performance Mode + VRR update,"With the new VRR updates on PS5 , it seems like the input lag has been eliminated , the controls is much more smoother than before.

Although Cyberpunk 2077 was not officially patched by CDPR to work with VRR  but the results is very good.

My PS+ subscription was also up for renewal in the coming days and so I bought a 12 month pre-paid card. I was unable to redeem this. I tried to extend my subscription in the PS store on my PS5 and I keep getting an error message.

So I rang Sony Support, they told my that my prepaid card still has a use on it so it's not an issue with the retailer, but were also unable to redeem it for me. I also mentioned about the PS store not allowing me to extend my membership and receiving an error.

They looked into it and said that multiple extensions are disabled at the moment. Clearly this is in preparation for the new PS+ switch.

But it's crazy that I could be without PS+ in a few days because of this, and who knows if I'll even be able to redeem my pre-paid cards."

Today, I read about VRR coming to PS5 and honestly, I am super excited. It remains to be seen how this particular feature will perform though. Hopefully, in the future, games will have a wider range of settings you can mess with like being able to turn off shadows which bother me a lot when playing FPS games. Good job Sony !"

When you upgrade you will be charged a pro-rated fee to level up the remaining time on your existing membership to the desired level. For example, if you purchased a 12-month membership five months ago and have seven months left, you will need to pay a pro-rated upgrade fee to upgrade your remaining seven months to the desired plan level.

PS5,ubn9bt,Games That Scratch the Detective Itch,"I'm not sure if I'm in the minority but I absolutely love these types of games. After just rewatching True Detective I really want to sit down and solve a murder and need some recommendations. On the PS5 the games are really few and far between but I know there has to be some hidden gems

L.A. Noire is the obvious choice but is pretty dated and at this point the facial animations just crack me up. I remember being obsessed with this game when it first came out and really wish Rockstar would dive into this genre again  


Disco Elysium is the one I've played most recently and damn is it good. I NEED more narrative games like this where your choices truly shape the story. One of those games where I wish I could wipe my memory and play again

Detroit: Become Human for certain sections is such an atmospheric detective game. Playing those sections as Connor at crime scenes was so good and makes me want Quantic Dream to develop a fully fledged detective game.   


Witcher 3's monster contracts honestly made you feel like Batman a bit - while there wasn't much choice in solving the mystery, following the clues and then consulting the bestiary once you had enough evidence to formulate your plan of attack was some fantastic detective gameplay.  


What other games am I missing? What is worth trying to scratch this itch? Thinking about possibly The Wolf Among Us before they release the new one. Is Sherlock Holmes Chapter 1 any good? The gameplay trailers I saw for it kind of turned me off. I recently tried Lost Judgement but the style was a bit too cheesy for me"

PS5,ubj86d,Data not transferring to USB flash drive + software errors,"For a few days now, I haven't been able to transfer data correctly from my Media Gallery to a flash drive, and it looks like the console's USB ports may have something to do with it. Seeing that there have been lots of posts around here detailing issues with the USB ports, I was wondering if anyone had this same specific issue:  


\- When trying to transfer screenshots from the Media Gallery to an external flash drive, the transfer process gets stuck at 0% indefinitely, and I'm forced to cancel eventually.  
\- Bizarrely, even after canceling at 0%, a portion of the screenshots do get saved to the drive. Although it's always the same batch from the same game. The console acts as if I only screenshots from that particular game existed.

\- Even MORE bizarrely, the console still copies those same screenshots from that same particular game to the flash drive even after I DELETED them from the Media Gallery, while remaining stuck at 0% and forcing me to cancel the copying process as usual.

\- I normally use the front USB-C port, but the problem happens with all of them. In fact, the console doesn't even recognize the front USB-A port when I connect drives to it.

\- I've been in touch with customer support about this and they had me reinstall the latest software update, restore licenses, reset console options to default settings, delete cache and rebuild database. Nothing worked.

\- Each time I try to transfer data from the Media Gallery and this happens, the console also takes an unusual long time to power off. It stays well over ten minutes on the ""Preparing to turn off your PS5..."" screen. Next time I power it on, an error screen pops up requesting a report to Sony.  


I have nearly 500 screenshots saved in the console and there's no way to get them out of there like this. I could try to factory reset the console, but that would wipe them out. And based on everything I tried, I'm not even sure that'd solve anything either. Support insisted that it's probably a minor issue, and they said I could always wait for the next OS update, but even that I'm skeptical off considering reinstalling the last one didn't do anything. It feels like a more serious problem overall."

It lists the Old Hunters DLC, but it just says ""usable"" next to it with no option to install it. It seemed to work when transferring Mortal Kombat 11 content, though I have the same issue for that game too with a 2 or 3 of the add ons.

PS5,uaz5vu,My PS5 suddenly stopped detecting ANY of my controllers.,"Hi guys! I need help, like really.

Since the PS5 update from March 23rd, none of my 4 Dualsense controllers are detected by my console. 

I tried to connect them with USB, by Bluetooth, Resetting with the small button. (basically everything i saw on Youtube) Most of the tutorial i saw online are not related to my problem.

In fact, my Dualsense is actually recognized by my console, and sometimes i'm able to navigate for about 3 minutes before it shuts down and then starts charging. After that, it doesn't work anymore. I read online that maybe it was some kind of problem related to other Bluetooth devices in the environment, so i installed my PS5 in my bedroom instead of my gaming room and it doesn't change anything.

After that, i decided to completely reset my console with Safe Mode. Funny enough, when connecting my controllers by USB in Safe-Mode, it actually works perfectly (which is strange)

Nothing changed at all. 

Now i can't even get past the initial setup of the console since the controllers are disconnected after 3min.

One of the last thing that i remember doing before the update was connecting my Dualshock 4 to my PS5 to see if it works. It looks like it's related to the problem since i can't even connect my DS4 anymore. 

It's so strange because my PS5 was working perfectly. And my controllers are detected by my PC too so basically it's just my PS5 that doesn't to cooperate.

Anyone can help me? Thanks !"

Beforehand I just used a headset connected to my controller to hear sound but I decided to hook up my Bose Soundtouch 300 to the system as well because I didn't always want to wear headphones (Monitor into HDMI output on the sound system, and PS5 plugged into the input). The Monitor is displaying but no sound is coming out, and I can't open any applications that use sound either (so like any games or streaming applications) because it says I'm not connected to the internet, this only happens when it's plugged into the soundbar).

I am fully aware that the PS5 GTA Online is completely free, but as mentioned, my friend play on PS4 and the game is not cross-gen. I would really appreciate somebody telling me if there is a way that I can play the game once again, or if I am required to buy the game again.

It will work sometimes but if I move around or touch it even the slightest it disconnects. The headset will also most of the time not even play sound through it. This is with every mic I connect and these mics work fine with ps4 but on ps5 they all seem to malfunction the same way with this controller. Is there any way to fix this?

I was scrolling through the store and I saw the N1&amp;2 RC for full price. €80. Includes all DLC it says. But I already have all DLC. 

Why is this collection so bloody expensive? Shouldn't the store automatically decrease the price when you already have a number of components from a pack? I watched some YT videos, but I don't think there's anything new or making it worth €80. So what's this price tag for? 🤔"

PS5,uatsb3,External HDD damaged files,"Hello, i am downloading some PS4 games on my new PS5 to my external HDD. Also I installd two disc games. After the installing process i wanted to start the game but the it couldn‘t launch it. I restartet my PS5. After the restart I got a Popup that said the external HDD was incorrectly removed. What caused it to happen? I did not remove the HDD!

The download of the other games was not completed (arround 50%). If i want to launch a game is said the files were damaged.

One game that was ready to play launched alright.

Should I redownload them all or can I continue with the download?

What can I do that this will not happen again?

Thanks in advance!
Sorry for my bad english :)"

PS5,uahjpf,Not happy with my PS5 (soon 1 year experience with it now),"Charge controller 2-3 days, playing with it on USB cable, use wire-less for like a day tops. The PS5 controllers is the most shitty thing i've ever had so far. Not to mention how a brand new controller just died after just a first months. I still have PS4 controllers that are today over 5 years old, never any issues.

For many reasons i feel that the PS5 in general is a flop to me. Be it the terrible, overcomplicated, stupid UI, the controllers, the lack of the next-gen feeling (playing HZD 2 on Ultra HD top TV and can't see much of a difference), the haptic that to me is rather annoying than cool, as feels half a\*\*ed. Also individual background pictures look so bad, laughable resolution. As for changing it i start my PS4 for it, to then use on PS5, as the PS5 for whatever reason makes it look shitty. Advertisements and 2 task bars...-\_- No option to create folders. A simple thing like leave a chat turned into a bothersome task.

I was never ever a Xbox fan. To me no way. But still, can't say that i'm much pleased with the PS5 so far. That never happened on any PS i had before, as i did really enjoy all of them and always felt improvement on upgrading.

With this one here i hardly do get used to. But that might be just my opinion."

I just bought the PS5 and tried to join it to my wireless network.

My WiFi network is compromised of an Extreme Networks AP305C supporting WiFi6.

All devices work on this AP depending on their capabilities either natively to WiFi6 on both 2.4G and 5G. Other downgrade to 802.11G, 802.11N or 802.11AC depending on their radio.

&amp;#x200B;

The PS5 works without any issues when I explicitly configure my AP on the 802.11AC protocol.

The DHCP server works and internet connectivity is OK.

When I try to offer 802.11AX on the AP all devices work except the PS5 where for some reason it does not accept the DHCP offer from the DHCP server.

&amp;#x200B;

The AP has been moved to direct line of sigh and a few meters away from the PS5 in order to check the power.

When it first connects it states approximately 90% power.

&amp;#x200B;

Static IP address assignment does not work either which makes me think that their is a bug on the WiFi6 protocol support.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried rebuilding the data base and nothing."
PS5,u9uc9b,I'm really tired of having to deal with the ps5's bullshit!,"      The ps5 is one of the most finicky devices I've ever owned. I'm so frustrated at it constantly, I feel like almost every other time I turn it on or boot up a game it throws an error at me. Most of the time it's a simple fix but it's so annoying. But the cherry on the sundae of shit just happened to me, I just had to factory reset my console (with no other options) just to get it to boot up. I don't pay for ps+ because I mostly only play single player games, but apparently it only cloud saves your data if you have it. 

      I've had my Xbox series X for about 6 more months than my ps5 and it is just works so much better. The thing that caused the need for a factory reset was a power outage during an update. They always say don't turn it off which I've tried to stick to but it happend anyway the  funny thing about that is same thing happened to my xbox series x and my xbox one x (maybe I should get my power checked out) but neither of them needed a factory reset it just started the download over. Also if it did factory reset on Xbox consoles you don't need xbox live to use cloud saves. 

    If it wasn't for exclusives (and maybe the dualsense) my ps5 would be in the garbage. Also having a ""software issue"" that deletes saves and locking cloud saves behind a pay wall is pretty damn shady."

A full price game should be priced as such so that a developer/publisher can make the profits they think fair for their effort but to charge 70 quid AND have micro transactions AND have adverts is inexcusable. We have allowed publishers to get away with including MTX in full priced games (don't get me started, you know who you are) but we can't lose this fight. I understand if a game is F2P, in that case have at it, but if you pay the launch price for a game then they have no right to include MTX and advertising, I honestly would rather pay 80 quid for a game if that's what it takes to ensure the future of a good dev but I cannot stomach adverts in games, I just can't. I wouldn't accept it in a DVD and we shouldn't accept it in games!

Please, for the love of gaming, NEVER buy a game that includes advertising no matter how 'unobtrusive' they promise they will be."

My question is, Sony have any contract with Scuff brand, they don't care about the FPS players on PS5? I would like to play MW2 (2022) for PS5 but if there is no Back Button for DualSense I will be forced again to play the PS4 COD version on my PS5 (it will be the third version, Cold War-Vanguard-MW2).

**Disclaimer**: This is the FIRST PS console I have ever owned!

I am not sure if this is expected from a PlayStation but I am slightly (negatively) surprised about the UI for the PS5. On a smaller scale, I expected the game icons to be bigger and detached from the PS Store and other icons.

But, on a larger scale, I expected the ""Close Game"" icon or the ""Turn Off PS5"" button to be visible without me clicking other buttons to get there.

Maybe it's just that I am not used to it and it's always been like this... Just wanted to know the opinions of those who are used to the PlayStation consoles."

PS5,u9lu18,Console availability,"It’s completely unacceptable to me that we’re nearing a year and a half since the PS5 was released and it’s still an Indiana Jones treasure hunt to find one. Big stores like Walmart and Target aren’t even attempting to do in-store sales, with signs that say they’re sold online only, where the rare restocks are gone seconds after you click refresh. GameStop sends out emails that drops will be happening, but only in limited quantities and only for Pro Members.

Can somebody explain to me *why* it’s been over a year and there’s still such an insane rareness to these machines? I work full time, go to school, and have a family.

PS5,u9l9w4,Don't Buy With BOA,"Whatever you do, don't use a bank of america card when buying one of these from walmart (or probably anywhere). Even after tons of declines when using a boa card at walmart and every time me telling them yes the charges are legit, they do it again and again on any future purchases.

So now I have a supposedly ""shipped"" digital ps5 only to then see the idiots at BOA declined the charge despite having approved the original charge for it. lol.

The tracking just says label created so obviously they won't ship and I'm sure walmart isn't competent enough to let me update payment and will cancel it all because ABOA and Walmart are both full of idiots.

Then walmart support just says if it's canceled order it again. yeah because that is so easy to order a digital ps5. lol.

What's funny is BOA constantly does this at almost every store, decline decline decline, yet when there really WAS fraud they didn't catch it and put thousands of bogus charges on my card."

I eventually signed up directly with PlayStation for a chance to buy, and lo and behold they email me 4 days ago saying my spot was on 4/20 at 2pm. I went in when the time came, finish line ahead, next up in the que, re-directed…there it is, a ps5 disc version. Retail. Add to cart. 

I click…window pops up “this item is no longer available”. Damn. I waited 52 minutes only to have them all sold out again. 

In disbelief and borderline Unfazed I click again. Message pops up again. But I see the digital version listed as out of stock, so I think something is up here. I mash add to cart and finally…boom, 1 ps5 added to cart. I order it. And when does it arrive, two days later, on my birthday.

I do have PS+ and snatched the free games for April and all the PS Collection Games (I just finished GoW and I am currently playing Bloodborne) but I am quite unsure of what games to buy and play next since this is my first PS console and I come from a heavy PC gaming background. I grew a bit too old for online and heavy grindy and repetitive mmorpgs (yeah, I'm talking about World of Warcraft) so even though I do not have a preference for any genre, I do like games with complex stories and mechanics (huge FromSoftware fan, played DS1/DS2/DS3/Sekiro and currently messing around in Elden Ring). So, what should I play next?

&amp;#x200B;

My current list looks kinds like this:

* Demons Soul
* Heavy Rain
* Beyond Two Souls
* Until Dawn
* ASTRO's PLAYROOM
* TLOU 1 &amp; 2
* Detroit Become Human
* inFAMOUS Second Son
* Watch Dogs Legion
* AC: Valhalla
* Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves
* Persona 5

To get the updates installing again, I need to restart my PS5.  And yes, I have power being supplied to my USB ports constantly.

Then the update for Fallout 76 appeared in my downloads.  But when I restarted my PS5, it said the data on it is corrupted to reformat, but I'm able to play my games though.

so I have recently ran into an issue with my ps5, whenever I started up or booted up fortnite or genshin impact my ps5 would automatically switch off and then when turned back on mention something about restoring storage. I’ve tried using a different outlet for higher power and less shared power aswell as trying a factory reset, but to no avail, I had the same problem when I re-downloaded fortnite and now it keeps auto shutting everytime I open fortnite. However rocket league seemed to work perfectly fine for a good hour with no problems and it still does work as far as I’m concerned.

PS5,u8z1hf,Ps5 direct shipping cost,"This so for anyone that has manage to buy a ps5 from Sony directly, how much do they charge for shipping I’ve been wanting one for a while and I need to know how much they charge for shipping?"
PS5,u8yh6n,Controller Seating (Official DualSense Charging Station),"Does anyone else with the official Sony branded DualSense Charging Station find the bridge on which the actual controllers sit to be absurdly narrow? You have to perch it on this tiny strip of plastic and it takes a little bit of wiggling every time you set a controller down to get the spring to launch and the charging pins to make contact.

&amp;nbsp;

I have two charging stations and I got so frustrated with it that as an experiment I added little rubber risers to the top of one (little strips of rubber along side the two spots where the controllers cradle, stuck between the white and black plastic of the charging station.) End result: They act as gripping feet for the controller bottom and you can drop the controller down willy-nilly and it just lands right on the charging spot every time.

&amp;nbsp;

Which leads me to the question: Why did Sony design the thing to be so fiddly? Extending those white plastic flanges additional *millimeters* upwards would have made it so much more stable!"

PS5,u8xni0,PS Direct Not Fulfilling Replacements,"TLDR: I sent my PS5 for exchange with PlayStation Direct after being told they had available replacements, but they’re now refusing to send the replacement due to a “technical issue” with their systems since March.

Be careful about doing exchanges with PS Direct. My WiFi would crash whenever connecting to a 5GHz WiFi network. After troubleshooting with PlayStation Support, I was offered warranty service but was told that I could end up with a refurbished unit. Keeping in mind that PS Support is separate from PS Direct where I bought my console, I figured it would be safer to go back to PS Direct and exchange for a new unit since it was within 30 days if they had any available.

I contacted PS Direct chat support, and my case was escalated for someone to call me about an exchange. We discussed at length that they had replacement inventory available, and I would receive my replacement within 10 business days, and so I agreed.

According to FedEx, PS Direct received my console on March 16. I had read about others receiving their replacements from PS Direct within just a few days, so I grew worried when the order status website hadn’t updated a week later. I spoke with PS Direct chat on March 23, but all they could say was to assure me that it would be sent out within 10 business days (with 5 more to go), that they saw my case was escalated, and that someone would reach out to me further.

No updates or contact a week later, so I reach out to PS Direct chat support on March 29. I am now told that the exchange policy is for 12 days instead of 10, and their website was updated to reflect that. They at least confirm receipt of my console according to their warehouse. I ask if the old 10 policy still applied to my replacement, and they agree to have a supervisor get back to me. (It seems the 12 days policy was temporary, as the website was updated again the next day back to 10 days.)
I follow up with PS Direct chat support again on March 31 and April 1, but nobody had any additional information. Later that day on April 1, I finally get a call from a PS Direct supervisor. I am told there is some problem with their system; they did receive my console; but it’s “stuck” in their system which prevents my replacement going out. I am offered a refund and told that I can try to purchase a new console in the next drop.

It's now April 21. I end up receiving only a partial refund and I still don’t have a PS5 console, and I'm stuck with a bunch of worthless games."

I read that you could make it faster with a lan cable connected to both the consoles but i connected them after i chose the Wifi option so i don't know if it works or if it just needs some time.

I also read somewhere that you could start the transfer again but how would you do that without the chance of glitching the consoles or something bad happening to them?

Sometimes I'll get home and boot up the PS5 and my notifications pop up saying this and that has updated while in rest mode and other times nothing will update. 

I've double checked that rest mode updates are allowed.

Does anyone have any insight into why this may be happing or possibly some sort of fix?

This is the one that has the 4 paddles, rubberized grips, and still retains all the original adaptive trigger functionality and haptics.

Here's a review from PC Magazine. Biggest knock against it seems to be price. [https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/scuf-reflex-pro](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/scuf-reflex-pro)

I'd love to sell this to someone locally (Orlando FL) to avoid shipping, but if you want to pay for shipping, I'll sell it to anyone. PayPal ONLY, or cash works too if we meet up locally. Not sure what to charge for shipping, but I paid $12.99 so probably something like that, or more if you want it expedited. 

Price is $229.99, same as what Scuf sells it for. 

NO NEGOTIATING. I'm not stuck with this, I can return it and they are waiving the restocking fee. I just thought it'd be cool to give someone the chance to grab one if they missed the pre-orders."

PS5,u8dca0,Sony should capitalize on native backwards compatibility. The PS5 is becoming boring.,"  

* The Playstation 2 was backwards compatible with the Playstation 1 OG. Initially, the Playstation 3 was backwards compatible with the PS2 and PS1.
* The Playstation 3 Slim and Super Slim were backwards compatible with the PS1.
* The PS4 had no backwards compatibility with previous consoles and struggled to emulate PS2 hardware such as games like the PS2-Classic: The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy. 
* The PS5 has backwards compatibility with the PS4, owing to the fact that the PS5 was built on the PS4 architecture, making them essentially the same. Needless to say, when I play a PS2-Classic title such as Bully on my PS5, it constantly freezes and stutters, much alike the PS4 version. 

Although each console's graphical developments are always next generation, their hardware capabilities post-PS3 era are going backwards at the same time as they are going forwards. After a few months of owning my PS5, I came to this conclusion. Whenever I felt the need to play games from previous generations, excluding the PS4, I had to tediously plug in either my PS3, PS2 or PS1. This, in turn, reduces the amount of time I can spend playing on my PS5. Since purchasing my Xbox Series X, I no longer need to plug in my previous generation Xbox consoles, unless I want to play something that is not on the backwards compatibility list, such as Two Worlds. I no longer have to worry about plugging and unplugging hardware, fumbling through AV cables/separate HDMIs, and finally deciding which game belongs to which generation in order to play. 

It would not be a waste of money to spend millions of dollars deciphering their own PS3 architectural language in order to get the games running natively on a PS5. What a waste of energy and money is Sony running hundreds, if not thousands of PS3s in a basement around the clock to be streamed by paying customers via PS Now, and eventually PS Plus Spartacus, despite the streaming service being nearly unusable for the majority of players due to technical issues/input lag/etc. Sony needs to up their game, and I say this as a die-hard Sony fan who has to resort to a 3rd-party such as Xbox in order to accomplish such things. I'm also willing to bet that no PS4 owner with no prior console experience has ever played Grand Theft Auto IV or Midnight Club LA. One might ask, ""What's the point of buying a new console if you're just going to play old games?"" The answer is to have more options for playing games; out with the old and in with the new applies to almost everything other than gaming. 

TL;DR All of this in a nutshell: sometimes, people, such as myself, get burnt out playing new games, and want to play titles of the past feasibly."

There is probably a bias there towards PS Plus members for Sony selecting you for a PS5 restock.  In the restock email, it said that you had to click the link at 2:00.  If you clicked the link before 2:00, it said that you would be blocked from the link.  I watched the clock and as soon as it turned to 2:00, I clicked the link only to find out that there was an hour long wait.  Are they allowing people in early?

Now that I was excited about the PS5, I decided to see if anyone had them available online. This resulted in me spending about $800 on a PS5 from Walmart.

Did I just drastically overpay?"

Do not get mad if they don't work for you please and thanks. Good luck to whoever does manage to use them.

PS5,u84v1h,"Wrong flag for ""limited 1 console per household"" ?","My friend and I both got invitations. We have been waiting to get PS5 for a long time. We were quite excited to get the chance to actually buy the console. But he was busy with work today so he asked me to do a favor. He gave me his CC info in advance.

I used two different PCs to login his queue and my queue. His queue(12min) was shorter than mine (20min) so I was able to order one for him successfully (that feeling was soooo good!), but when I tried to order mine PlayStation kept telling me the item is limited 1 per household. It is two PSNs, two shipping addresses, two names, two credit cards and two billing addresses.  I guess IP address cannot be same either? Anyway the stock was gone, so I only managed to score one for my friend. 

I will try again next time but I am worrying that PS may already flagged my PSN as a PS5 owner by mistake? Any advice is appreciated."

PS5,u84o1d,Having power issues with brand new PS5,"I purchased a brand new PS5 in early April, and one day the console suddenly turned off by itself. I tried to turn it on manually by pressing the ""Power"" button, and no budge. It would blink blue once and turn off. I can't even access its ""Safe Mode"" state. Not even the fans work. I tried everything in the troubleshooting book to get it working, and nada. I tried returning it today at Gamestop, but they couldn't do anything since I didn't get the warranty on it (maybe that was my bad). I sent a ticket to Sony for repair, and I hope I hear from them soon. Has anyone had the same problem as me?"

PS5,u83xs4,Playstation Direct Process is Rediculous,"Recently got the lottery invite to the Playstation Direct website to buy a console. After clicking on the link right at opening (did it right at :00:00) and then waiting in a 15-minute queue, they sold out within a minute of me entering my information. I understand that in these processes the receipt of an email, getting to the front of the queue, or apparently even having it in your cart is no guarantee to a console but this is getting ridiculous. The Playstation Direct stock drops should work in a way that, since they are already limiting it to one console per household, there are exactly as many units available as emails they send out. That way, the lottery system is effectively a reservation of a console. I understand that not every person who gets the email will participate in the drop so they open it up to more people than they have supply for but honestly underselling in each drop wouldn't be the worst thing. It would allow them to role supply over to the next drop, allowing for more frequent drops. It would also build more goodwill with the customer, which Sony is lacking on given the shitty release this console has had over the last two-three years. At the moment, and I have seen others on here who feel the same way, they have a customer who was excited to be given a chance only for the rug to be pulled out from underneath them when their hope was at its highest. Obviously, I am grateful to have had the opportunity but I am bordering on just giving up until the next iteration of this generation. The world is back open (at least from a Western/Northern perspective), there is no longer an argument for the inability to have units in the store like every other console release ever, similarly limited to one console per government ID or whatever other form of limiting. Sony, as I am sure I am the millionth and one person to say it, fix your fucking shit."
PS5,u83q4v,PS Invitation / Direct - Success Rate?,"Hi everyone - 

Like so many out there, it’s been a tough 1.5 years of hunting for a PS5… plenty of “almost mine” moments and the never-ending debate over just going to a reseller.

But then I think my problems are solved(!!) - PlayStation has a direct, invitation-only way of buying the console?!

Sign up, wait the 6 weeks, only to the discover it’s just like Target, BestBuy, or any other store - a queue and “good luck” chances on actually getting one.

For those who’ve experience with it, or gotten a PS5 through it, curious what your takes are on the PS5 direct option for buying?  How many times did you register before finally queueing early enough to get one?

FWIW - I clicked the link about 2 minutes after the window opened.

Thanks!"
PS5,u83p16,What is going on??,"Seriously why is it so difficult to just buy a PS5, wtf is the deal here?"
PS5,u83mk1,PS5 registration is pointless,I registered a couple of months ago on Sony’s website to purchase a ps5 and received an email yesterday saying I was invited to purchase a ps5 today. I clicked the link I was sent at the time it told me to and I was placed in a queue for 30 minutes. I was let into the site to purchase a console but both the disk version and the disk less version were out of stock. I was so hyped to finally be able to buy one to only have my hopes let down. Screw Sony for the dumb system they have set up. It said I had ten minutes to complete the process and “out of stock” were the first words I saw when I was let into the site.

Anyone else experienced this? Also, how are folks experiences with the repair system? Is it worth bypassing altogether and just accepting the need for a new controller?

As an aside, the dualsense drift issue really is ridiculous. I experienced it on the much less robust Switch controllers after maybe a year. To experience it on something as otherwise well made as the PS5 after less than half that time is laughable. The fact that they push £60 atm and are in kinda short supply just kinda adds to the frustration."

I do not think my HDD is failing for the following reason.  


1. Currently own a PS4 Slim 1TB, bought it brand new in 2020.
2. Usage: solely gaming. For most of the period (2022 until now) since I have bought it, I seldom have time to play on it. If I do play, the usage time on average is 1-3 days per week, each time 2-3 hours. 
3. Storage usage: never used up more than 50% of maximum capacity.
4. PS4 is handled with care, never drop it, cleaned the dust so no overheating, turn off properly when not in use.

So I want to ask fellow PS4/PS5 owner, do you have this issue?"

&amp;#x200B;

My ps5 has the problem that it will every now and again not turn on properly and will need to be started into safe mode to clear the the cache until will not just boot to a black screen. This will last for a bit, and after about 5 or 6 months I haven't had to do it at all. Until two nights ago I had to do it twice in the week. Now today, after getting an error message for my ps5 over heating, I was going to rebuild the database from safe mode, but now for the life of me cannot get it to start in safe mode. It will make the second beep, change the light color from blue to white indicating that it is indeed in safe mode, but just like how my normal launch would be to a black screen, this is now only showing that black screen for safe mode. Even stranger, is that I am infact able to launch it normally all the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried power cycling twice now, tried different outlets, but cannot get it to launch back to safe mode. Anyone have any suggestions I haven't tried yet? Will be contacting Playstation support soon."
PS5,u7ndxy,A Few Questions About Upgrading to a PS5,"Before I upgrade to a PS5, I have a few questions that google only has 12-18 month old answers for.

1. My PS4 games are on an external Seagate PS4 HDD. Can I just plug-and-play, or will I have to transfer my games to the PS5?
2. I've heard some rumblings about saves not transferring from PS4 to PS5, is that still an issue (if it ever even was)?
3. Do Games that have a PS5 upgrade need to be re-downloaded in their entirety or do they just need a patch downloaded?

And finally, the big boy...

4. Is copying still a thing?

I know there are scams left and right for this sort of thing so I just want to make sure it's legit before throwing my card details at it."

PS5,u7l1s7,Anyone still having trouble connecting their controllers to their PS5 after the newest update?,"I’ve had this problem since the last update. My controllers will not connect to my PS5 at all and the PS5 has been basically bricked since I can’t play any games. I’ve recently found out that if I disconnect from the internet by restoring my default settings via safe mode, my controllers work completely fine. However, since I am not connected to the internet, I can’t play online or download any digital games. I expected this to be fixed by this latest update but I haven’t heard a statement from Sony acknowledging this problem even if not many people are experiencing this. I’ve been having my PS5 since day one and I’ve never had a problem with it until last months update."

PS5,u7i472,Just got my invitation to buy a ps5 directly from Sony tomorrow.,Gotta say I’m pretty excited.

PS5,u7i3mi,PS5 success story.,"In idk about other states but in Utah there's a store called RcWilley. And they sell electronics. Today i decided to look on their site to see if they had stock but their site said ""out of stock"". On their site the PS5 digital version is listed for $469. I was confused about this as we all know the digital version is $399. So i decided to email the store and see why the price was higher than retail and if they would price match the retail price of the item since it was listed somewhere on their site. Within minutes i received a response. 
The agent explained that the price is that way because it's actually bundled with a controller. Hence the $69 dollar price hike. 
I said ok cool, now that makes sense. I proceeded to ask if they were getting any new stock soon and they responded that they usually get stock every 2-3 months. He added that he could add me to a wait-list if I wanted to. I gave him my information to be added to the wait-list and he responded that they actually had a digital version in stock if I wanted to purchase it. 
I was shocked! I was not expecting them to have stock since I was just looking for info. 
I told him yes I want the PS5 (obviously) and he then sent me an email confirming that the PS5 was on hold for me. I left work and headed straight to the warehouse and I got my PS5! 

I'm so glad I didn't give in to any scalpers and that my patience stayed with me along the way. 

For anyone still in search of a reasonably priced  PS5 don't give up. I know this shortage is annoying but don't give in, you got this."
PS5,u7ghut,”Relaxing” game,"Hi guys and girls, 

So how should I put this. When I game I play a lot of games where you need to be focused, like really focused. For example F1, it’s a very unforgettable game, like NHL with the whole Ultimate team mode where you need to play to get packs and hopefully good players and so on.. 

What I’m trying to say is that many of the games I play today is sometimes mentally draining and I need something that can be relaxing in some way. Like I want a game where you can come in, do something for an hour or tow, it won’t impact anything, it doesn’t push you to do any missions or anything like that to beat a boss. 

Do you have any tips?"

PS5,u7f302,Buying a digital version of a physical game,"Probably a simple answer, but wanted to confirm before: 

Currently playing ""The Last Of Us II"" on the PS5, using the disc / physical version. All our other games are digital, except SackBoy which our little girl plays. The way the PS5 is set up, swapping the discs between games is a bit tedious.

We scored some PSN card from a contest a while back, and see that Last of Us II is currently on sale. 

If we buy the 'digital' version on the Playstation Store to avoid needing the disc, do we basically just uninstall the current one and then download + re-install using the digital one for it to no longer ask to insert the disc?

Assuming save states are, well, saved lol..."
PS5,u7ewa8,Dualsense pressing random buttons/not taking inputs?,"I have two Dualsense controllers, one that came with the console and another of the colored line that i’ve only been using for a few weeks. Neither have ever been dropped, damaged, etc. Since i updated the controllers to the newest update, i’ve been having almost constant issues with them. It’s not quite stick drift, and it affects every button. If i press a button, it’ll act like i’m holding it down for about 5 seconds or so, and occasionally the buttons just straight up don’t work. I’ve tried powercycling the controllers, the console, resetting the controllers, and unpairing them. Unpairing and resetting seems to fix the issue for about ten to twenty minutes, but then it comes back the same as before. I didn’t have this issue at all before i updated, and even after the first controller started having the issues, the second controller still did not until it was updated. is there any fix for this???"

I own a ps5 digital only. I started to play fifa 22 and nba 2k. Problem is I get tired of them so I delete them. But I still want to play them and redownload them and get sick of them again and delete them again to make space for other games. 
I must have done this like 20 times for fifa and 10 times for nba.

PS5,u7e2e3,Overheard some resellers talking…,"Was at a thrift store and there were a couple resellers that beat me to the video games, they just had them all stacked in front of them and were scanning through them with Amazon app. Ugh I hate seeing this but it what it is. They were talking loudly though and bragging about how many PlayStation 5 consoles they had. One claimed to have 5 consoles and the other had 4. 

I already have a PlayStation 5, so I am not worried, but still frustrating to hear this. They were talking about they were hold long term until the prices are at peak. 

My opinion on this is that prices have since peaked, and I for one would refuse to buy from a reseller out of principle. Hearing them brag like this just makes me hope they get stuck with the consoles lol. Yea maybe a bit immature on my part, but I just want customers that actually want the console to have them, not resellers. What do you guys think?"
PS5,u7du89,Playstation Account wrongfully suspended,"So basically, I redownloaded LBP3 on my playstation because I was really bored. I went and tried to find worlds that would offer free items from the story since I didn't really wanna complete it. I found some but there was one specific world that was so messed up. It was basically a troll and wasn't giving anything. It was literally costumes of sackboys in KKK costumes that were surrounding what I can assume a black person on an upside down cross on fire. Now what I would assume a right minded person would do was to report it, which I did. I literally went to the good grief option then selected report and wrote that this was literally a KKK rally and I didn't expect that I needed to explain that much as the screenshot that was required to be posted was self explanatory.

Later after 5 minutes to my surprise I see a notification that I breached playstations code of conduct. I check my phone and I get an email that I am banned from using playstation services for 7 days due to hateful content.

I tried contacting playstation live chat and they said they cannot help me and I'd just have to wait out the days I'm suspended for. I tried calling live support and they wouldn't help at all and whoever I spoke to they would say the same thing ""that the safety moderation team takes investigations very seriously and their decision is final"" and they have it in their system that I got reported for hate speech even though it was technically ME who reported a game level and got myself banned. Is it cause in the report description I said ""it's literally a KKK rally?"" with a screenshot attached??? You cannot tell me a human being went and saw my report and made that decision. It had to be a bot and they do not want to admit that because no sane person would go through and suspend me for what happened.

And now I'm going to be stuck being paranoid not knowing what will happen if I get suspended again for doing nothing and not knowing how severe they can make it. There is nothing I can do about it nor anyone I can talk to that can actually help me. I guess whenever I see anything that's fucked up I'll leave it be because in the end I'm going to get punished."

PS5,u7dhdi,definitely give Cyberpunk 2077 a try on PS5,"This game is definitely playable with the current patch (1.52), I really enjoyed it unfortunately I can't share any screenshot in here but CD Projekt put a lot details in the game world in the story and characters. The story has deep roots, the characters are unique the game play is flexible it can be done  both stealthy or all out combat, the gun play is awesome so as melee or using Katana they all feel unique and special. The visual and details are stunning on PS5. I can describe every aspect of the game but that be spoiling so much of it. Self discovery is definitely worth it for something like this. but the world of Cyberpunk is definitely worth discovering the lore and culture its very interesting. I personally enjoyed playing this game I have over 167 hours of game play, and during this time I have encountered few visual bugs but nothing that prevented me from playing the the game, I had very few game crashes in patch (1.5) but since patch 1.52 that happens very rarely. If this post ends up encouraging you to play this game definitely share what you think of it afterwards."

PS5,u75pai,Sackboy is a better Mario 3D World,"There. I said it, I know I’m gonna piss off someone for saying that but in my opinion, Sackboy takes inspiration from Mario 3D Worlds but actually improves it and does its own things enough to make it stand and here is why:

- Levels in 3D World are fun but really forgettable, short, and most not having unique visuals. I barely remember a few if I have to be honest with you. 
Sackboy on the other hand, I think I remember almost every single level I have played. They are all very memorable, beautiful art direction, right amount of length, and still fun to go through. Especially music style levels. 

- Co-op in my opinion feels a lot more thought-out in Sackboy than Mario 3D World. For starters, it still has chaotic elements but encourages team work through gameplay a lot more, especially at few levels that require another person. Also, we didn’t had to wait until the switch for online co-op in Mario 3D World. Sackboy had that shit at launch.

- Lastly, side stuff in Sackboy feel actually rewarding and get challenging but still keeping the core fun platforming and reward you with post game world. What does 3D World do? Having to require to 100% the game each as the four playable characters and having to do through slow ass captain toad stages that made me fall asleep. Yeah, thats why I never bothered to 100% 3D World.

If you like 3D World more, I respect your opinion but please. Stop calling Sackboy a ripoff of that game."

Ultimately, I'm looking to sell my system for what I bought it for, but don't know if that is possible (have the supply issues been resolved?)

The system is the version with a disc drive and it has about 100 hrs of playtime on it. Would it be possible to get my $650 back for the system, 2 controllers, and charger (I will only sell it as a set)? Are there any scams I need to be wary about? How do I erase my data from the machine? I plan on putting a CL ad to sell it, so I guess someone would need to come into my house unless someone else has an idea of how to sell it while avoiding that. I'm hoping to sell it to someone in their 30s/40s looking to escape life."

PS5,u6o6et,Playing PS5 remote on Samsung s7 plus tablet,"I only recently learned that Sony allows remote play on the PS5. I downloaded the app to my tablet only to find the dual sense control(which works fine in android itself) doesn't work in the PS remote app. I chose the easy route to get around this and used my PS4 dual shock, but it appears to have a bad battery or something, keeps dying, so I was back to finding a way to get the dualsense to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually saw an article that said they fixed the issue in May 2021, but that doesn't seem to be the case for every device. The dual sense works fine with PS remote on my pixel 3, but not trying to play on that small of a screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are some other apps aside from Sonys official one so I bought PSPlay and tried it, the dual sense still doesn't work wirelessly on the s7 plus, but does work wired, which i can tolerate but is not preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I am missing as to why it works wireless on one device but not another with the same version of android(well Samsung has OneUI, but I meant both Android 12).

PS5,u6must,No option to request access to restricted titles?,"Hello, everyone!

So, I’ve ran into a bit of a problem, with some games being restricted on my PS5, with no option to request access to the ‘restricted’ games that I try to play. 

I’ve tried following advice in a few threads, but have encountered problems because A) my account gives me no control or ability to turn off parental controls (when I click a profile, it just gives me a basic rundown of username and email address - utterly useless) and B) my ‘parental settings’ are tethered to the age of my PSN account, so I can’t change it that way either. 

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated :)"

PS5,u670cv,What are your PS5 Pet Peeves?,"I absolutely adore the PS5 but I've gotta admit...there are a couple of things I wished were better. It took AGES for me to get used to the PS button compared to how it worked on the PS4 so I wish that just worked in a similar way but I'd say ny biggest gripe would be how party chat works with the controller. Lemme explain...

When you enter a party chat you can use the PS5's built in mic. Not the greatest mic in the world but it does the job, wonderful. However, the party chat audio comes out of controller as well and it is QUIET! You can barely hear ehat your friends are saying no matter how loud you crank all settings up and you'll most likely need to turn your TV down to hear anything. However, there's no option to get the party chat audio to come through the TV screen while you're using your controller's mic as an option, which forces me to use headphones. I've had to grow accustomed to using the headphones but before I was very pleased with using the PS4 camera as my mic in party chats and just have the TV as the speakers. No need for headphones, it was a glorious age...

One last pet peeve would be the HD Camera. I kinda get why it doesn't have a built in mic but yo...gimme a mic dammit 🤣"
PS5,u66t0c,HDR makes screen flicker,"I had a 1080p monitor and decided to get a budget 4K TV (ACER 4K BL SERIES) to play the PS5 on. Everything worked great, until I turned on the HDR. It had no issues when I turned it on while I'm logged in on the console, but restarting my TV or PS either makes the screen flicker (in black) or I get a ""No Signal"" error.

I've tried 3 different HDMI cables, including a 2.1. As per a few suggestions found around the internet, I've tried switching off the HDCP, tried -1 &amp; -2 transfer rate, turned off Overscan on my TV Picture setting, but to no avail.

Confused if it's a hardware problem or something to do with an option in the TV or the PS. Everything runs smooth with the HDR turned off, or if I turn it on after the PS is turned on without it. I've played 7-8 hrs of game with HDR on but the moment I restart either of the devices it goes back to this flickering freak show."

PS5,u65l2o,Doja Cat PS5 Ad, 
PS5,u65etw,Sony really needs to do something about PS+ redemptions blocking PS5 upgrades,"So I picked up a physical PS4 copy of Overcooked: All You Can Eat recently due to it having a free PS5 upgrade which I decided to grab today, despite already having the PS5 version redeemed through PlayStation Plus. To my dismay, I learned that if you've redeemed the PS5 version of the game through PS+, it acts as though you already own the game and won't give you the option to redeem your free upgrade. Some might ask ""Well who cares? You already have the game through PS+ then so just install that"". Well, yes, but let me make a couple of points on why that isn't ideal:

First and foremost, we don't ""own"" PlayStation Plus titles. These are temporary licenses that expire once your PlayStation Plus expires. If I've purchased a PS4 game that is meant to give me access to a full, permanent license to a PS5 game, I'd like to be able to redeem that whether I have the PS+ license or not. Instead, I'm stuck with the temporary license.

Second, when you put a PS4 disc into your system, it checks to see if there's a PS5 upgrade available. If there is, the disc won't install immediately. This gives you the ability to choose which version you'd like to install first and is great for saving space. I say this because when the PS5 first released, if you placed a PS4 title into the system that had a PS4 upgrade, it would install the PS4 game regardless and basically take up double the space. This was later patched to give you the option before anything installed. If you've redeemed the PS5 version through PS+ however, it skips this check, and immediately starts installing the PS4 version off the disc as soon as it's placed in the system - exactly how it worked before it was patched.

I have looked online to see if there's a way around this issue. Someone suggested deleting all versions of the game, then hiding the PS+ version from your library. Apparently this would allow you to grab the PS5 upgrade from the store, but it seems this method no longer works. Some people have also tried contacting PlayStation Support to get their PS+ license removed, which they've been told can't be done.

Now, to be fair, I have no idea if when my PS+ runs out everything will revert back to how it should be and I'll be able to grab my free upgrade. But I really shouldn't have to wait that long for a feature that's advertised on the box."

PS5,u5ykgn,anyone kno why my PS5 controller isnt working?,"ok here's the story...

 i'm on pc, not console. until recently i havent held a console controller in my hands since sega dreamcast was the newest thing out. anyways, i recently wanted to buy a game i have to have a controller for so i ordered a PS5 controller from amazon. while waiting for it to arrive my roommate let me borrow his old PS4 controller.  he installed something on my pc for it to recognize it as a PS controller instead of Xbox. the PS4 controller worked fine.  the PS5 controller arrived and it worked fine too but then i stopped using it right away bc i didnt feel like configuring all my buttons again and got bored of that game anyways so i put the controller away for a week... then i decided to get back on that game and the controller wouldnt work... the border around the touchpad would flash blue for a second then turn off... i restarted my pc and it worked fine again. then i stopped playing that game again for good and put the controller away again for like 6 weeks.

so i bought another game that needs a controller and the controller wasnt working again... i figured it was sitting in a box for 6 weeks maybe it just needed to be charged so i left it plugged in all night but it still wouldnt turn on, it would just have the flashing blue lights around the touchpad then turn off... then i remembered how before restarting my pc fixed it so i restarted my pc and it worked just fine again but then the very next time i unplugged it it wont turn on again no matter wat i do but my roommate's PS4 controller still works fine.

any ideas?"
PS5,u5y7jw,What 2-3 specific recent gaming experiences have made you felt EXCEPTIONALLY HAPPY to be a PS5 owner?," For me, it's been

1) Playing Elden Ring PS4 version and experiencing that game at a perfect 60 fps which PCs can't even do atm 😂😂😂🤷🤷🤷 it literally never deviates from 60 fps (I'm level 300 slowly playing through the game cuz that's how I do it, max out my favorite stats in the first 3rd of action RPGs 😆😆😆)

2) Playing the PS5 next gen patch for GTA V Online and experiencing almost perfectly consistent 60 fps using the ""performance with ray-tracing"" graphics mode while experiencing very immersive haptic feedback on the Dualsense. Gunplay feels real with trigger resistance that actually does it's job. Driving is a joy and feels and looks great 1st person on a motorcycle feels NICE. 

And music vibrates the controller so you feel like you're ACTUALLY in a club, car, etc. It's pretty next level and shockingly well done! They really invested in Dualsense optimization (LOOKING AT YOU ELDEN RING😒😒😒😒).

3) Fortnite on PS5 is ridiculously smooth and fast loading and this season has no building and added sprinting so it's just fast gun play and running around, I am a poor man but playing this game on PS5 makes me feel like I am rich if that makes sense 😉👍🙏 just wanted to share, thanks!"

PS5,u5utnb,I just beat Ghostwire: Tokyo yesterday after 30ish hours. Here’s my honest review,"I had my eye on this game ever since it was announced. The aesthetics immediately grabbed my attention, and the game director at the time of the Bethesda E3 was both charming and passionate. The game quickly joined my other list of potential buys, and I kept it on my radar over the months

Some troubling developments made me concerned: the director left, the game seemed to shift from horror to action, etc. but the biggest thing working against it was it’s release window. Coming out so soon after some gargantuan releases like Horizon Forbidden West and Elden Ring meant there was very little chance it was a day one purchase anymore. My game of choice was Elden Ring, and after 300 hours across 3 playthrough and a platinum later,  I found myself in that dreaded, nebulous mindstate most of us fall into

“What’s next?”

I tried playing through Kirby, Control, and Alan Wake. I felt like I was on the right track, but something still wasn’t clicking. Then I took a crack at Ghostwire, and here we are again wondering what’s next. I’m pretty sure the gameplay gave me the shooter itch so I’m going to replay Doom Eternal on PS5 this time so I can get into the DLC naturally since I beat the game before any had dropped. But before I do, I wanted to take some time to write out my thoughts on this probably hidden gem of 2022. I know, I know, it just came out a month ago. But something tells me this might not have done as well as Tango or its fans would want, so here’s hoping it does well on Xbox so a sequel can still happen

I think my biggest gripes with the game are the lackluster New Game+ and nitpicks with combat and traversal. Since there aren’t a whole lot of negatives, let’s get those out of the way

#NEGATIVES

New Game+ does not inspire one to complete the game for a casual fan. Because basically nothing important carries over, I did not feel incentivized to collect every lost spirit, hidden tanuki, or artifact for cats. Which is a shame because this is a game that would excel at power fantasy on subsequent playthroughs. So as much as I enjoyed my time the first go around, I had no qualms jumping ship once the main mission and side missions were complete. I didn’t mind the mostly empty world since it fit the aesthetic and story, and there are enough enemies and activities to occupy you running, flying, and…crouching through Tokyo?

This is my next negative: the combat and traversal need some work. There’s just no getting around that, as much love as you’re going to see in a sec…there are some minor and major gripes here. First off, there is zero reason for there to be a crouch button if you’re not going to have a slide mechanic. You have vaulting, you have jumping, and yet I still feel like I’m playing a shooter from the early 2000s. Not that there’s anything wrong with that since the combat was worked on by someone who worked on Doom 2016 and that game had heavy inspiration from its own history…but considering you have spirit powers and can glide, you’d think KK would let Akito dodge on the ground and in the air. So here’s my compromise: have parts of the game where crouching is needed use a context specific button prompt, or remove crouching sections entirely. Regardless of the decision here, the crouch button should now be a dodge. If you want to make it a slide when you’re running, fine…but the guard/parry are not enough defensive options, and crouch is frankly useless. As is melee combat and the bow

The least fun thing any game can do is take away the power fantasy. It’s not just a speed bump, it’s an absolute momentum killer. People who played Spider-Man know exactly what I’m talking about with MJ or Miles Morales missions. The parts of the game where KK is removed from Akito, even enemy attacks, SUCK. The bow feels horribly underpowered, undercooked, and like an afterthought. Unless you use prayer beads and (IMO) waste skill points on the bow…it’s just not fun at all. I didn’t sign up for discount Far Cry, I wanted to be Japanese Doctor Strange! For fuck’s sake, the biggest draw for me is the fact that it’s a First Person Shooter without traditional shooting mechanics! Which brings me to melee…why? Just why? You have this guy harnessing the power of the literal elements and his melee is a baby slap? Make him weave with melee! Supercharge his fists or something with rocks! Anything would be better, even a katana or SOMETHING to make it feel weighty when you have a chance to sneak a melee hit for SP regain

Okay…I think that’s the negative. I actually mostly have positives for the game

#POSITIVES

For starters, I think the story is serviceable. I grew to care about the leads, even if it falls under the trap of “the main missions seems really pressing, but I’m gonna not do that for dozens of hours” trope open world games fall into. While I did not care much for the villain, this could be fixed with him having a more taunting relationship with the leads through his “broadcasts”. I enjoyed the world and aesthetics, and if anything am grateful such an excellent modern depiction of Tokyo is now playable. The enemy variety is decent, but the AI could be more aggressive so long as my suggestions for combat and traversal are implemented to make it “fair”

I love love love the talismans but think the button placement is wonky. I’m not crazy about putting it where the bow is on the touchpad (swipe left) or down on the d-pad, but it definitely can’t stay where it is as is. I also found that once I got used to using the touchpad for changing spells I NEVER used R1 to change spells again. So here’s my thought: since it is essentially a “grenade”, put it on R1 and make that the only radial menu if you hold it to change the type. Since Xbox won’t have a touchpad, make all spell swaps on the D-pad regardless of console. If the bow is removed per my negatives on it above, you could have a different element on the left

#CONCLUSION

I realize none of these changes can be implemented for the game in a patch or even DLC. These are more like my suggestions for a sequel. I think after some reflection, I would grade Ghostwire: Tokyo at a 7.5 / 10, maybe 8 / 10 on a good day. I think with some more time in the oven (and less of an identity crisis), the sequel could be 9 or 10 out of 10. Very fun game, and when the combat clicks and you’re in a groove switching between spells it’s addicting tbh

P.S.: Overhaul the sensitivity settings. Just start from scratch. Even with MAJOR tweaking, I was never in love with the camera. When I booted up Doom Eternal, it was perfect right out the gate. Granted, Id are the GOATS of FPS, but still"

PS5,u5oyky,An Important Message For You Who’s PS5 Still Turns Off On Its Own - Why This Happens &amp; How To Truly Fix It.,"A brief recap on my personal experience with this issue. Skip paragraphs if you don’t want be bothered with my story.

My PS5 was turning itself off on its own while playing PS5 games (even PS4 update versions), several times a day. I cleaned it the best I could, following dozen of guides and advice everywhere I could find for this to no avail. I did ALL the TS steps from PlayStation support twice, I changed plugs, tried plugging it directly to the wall plug, you name it, but the issue persisted. I tried the vents for cooling and absolutely nothing was working. For months and months this was my reality.

One day, I was talking to a friend who I did not see for a long time. He fixes boat motors now and other sailing ship stuff and we ended up discussing motors and vents and from there I gave the PS4 and PS5 vents as an example for something I can’t recall. The discussion went to my current PS5 issue I had and he said to bring it in for him to check since I had nothing to lose.

I do it on the next day without expecting much. So I opened the PS5 for him and he said it looked very clean, and he saw the opening and overall venting system. He grabbed an air pressure gun, I mean a HUGE one used on boats, that shit was loud, and he adjusted the pressure. It was strong enough to push his hand slightly back when pressed against it.

I was very nervous but he started to explain that dust and cloth can diminish the full rotational potential of the fan and it could be why no matter how clean it was it would never stop telling the system to shut down. 
He went on and on about more technical stuff. I was afraid the potency of the air pressure would damage something inside but he told me it would be very unlikely so I trusted him.

So he started doing his thing and there was cloths of dust coming of from deep inside the PS5, nothing really surprising. Then he pointed the air pressure gun in an angle towards the vent and made it spin to max for around 10 secs. I was almost shitting my pants but again, I had nothing to lose.

He did that a couple more times and told me to let him know in a couple of days how it was. It’s been 1 month and a half and the PS5 has NEVER turned off again no matter how long it’s on or what I’m playing.

So yeah, I would definitely recommend going to a workshop to get this process done to the vent cause it worked flawlessly. Even the noise it’s lessen.

I think there’s hope for yours too. It’s not the end guys! Take it from me, who struggled every day trying to fix it in any way I could. In the end it took a boat expert XD 

Stay safe!"

PS5,u5l41z,this needs addressing,"I just got suspended for a week after some kid threatened to ban me after losing in a rainbow six match. I didn't send or say anything against the terms of service. He straight up mass reported my account and threatened to abuse the report system and he has. 

A fresh smurf account with like 10 games on it fucking mass reports my decade old account with 500+ games on it. I'm not understanding. I report people who send porn and gore to groups on psn and their accounts are still up and fine but I tell a kid to fuck off and leave me alone and I damn near get banned.

 I love sony but the report system is fucking broken and is used constantly against people by toxic ass children.
I pay my subscriptions, I buy games and I haven't had a single report levied against me for the 10 plus years I've been on psn and now in 2022 some stupid ass fortnite and siege playing kid can just get me suspended or worse? 

I've put thousands of dollars into my playstation account over the years and I specifically go out of my fucking way to avoid stuff like this. I literally do everything in my power to avoid toxicity and avoid getting banned and now kids can just fuck me and my account anyway.  Years of games, trophies, data and thousands of dollars can be gone just because some kid lies and reports my swear word. I'm tired of everything I do in games hinging on stupid ass salty ass children. 

I didn't tell this kid to go fuck himself or go kill himself. I told him ""fuck off and leave me alone"" and that's an offense to sony? I bust my ass at work every single day to be able to afford what I do on psn and some stupid ass kid who uses his mommy's credit card can just take all that away from me and others.
