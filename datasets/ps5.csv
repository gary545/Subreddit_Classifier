PS5,vnmfzv,Wifi Adapter not initializing,"So, this has been bugging me for a while. I'm going to head this off by saying that I'm an IT guy with over 20 years of experience in various IT domains and networking is one of them.

I have an Asus RT-AX58u router that has both 2.4 and 5GHz enabled. Within the same home/apartment I also have a residential Wifi AP. Here's what's been happening with my PS5 ever since I've had it:

I turn on the PS5, and it will say I am offline. I check the network settings, and it won't show ANY SSIDs at all. Scanning for networks shows nothing. It should be showing:
 - My router's SSID
 - My apartment community's Resident Wifi
 - My apartment community's Guest Wifi
 - Next-door neighboor's Wifi broadcasting capable devices (printers, routers, extenders, etc)

And these following steps will work intermittently, or not at all to get the WNIC to connect to the appropriate SSID:
 - Restart PS5
 - Put the PS5 in Rest Mode
 - Shut the PS5 down
 - Completely power cycling by unplugging the PS5 from power and pressing the power button to clear any charge from the PS5

It is getting rather frustrating to come home, turn on the PS5 from rest mode, to find that it lost connection to the network. I'd perform the above 4 steps, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, trying to get it to recognize ANY available SSIDs at all.

Is there a known issue with the PS5's NIC's to not initialize properly??? I have a hard time finding any resources online that discuss this... so I feel like I'm about to have to get Sony to service this thing. But, before I do, I wanted to see with the community if anyone else has had this issue.",,1656526803

Does anyone have some clue when this game will go on sale? I've been playing a library copy recently and really like it, which surprised me. But multiplayer kinda sucks as I rarely find people to summon and as unlikely I get summoned. Apparently this is a player base issue? If so, you'd expect a sale to increase that player base. On the other hand, it's been so popular that they may just continue to milk it for full price. I'd like to buy but I've waited so long for a deal I feel I'm already dug in and need to wait lol.",,1656522808

It started happening when I was playing Warzone and then after resetting the controller and console a couple of times it was still not working properly even in the ps5 Home Screen and menus. Oddly, I started playing FFX-HD and it was working fine the whole time but then when I go back into COD is stops working again. For some reason I have a strange feeling that COD itself is causing this because Warzone has done strange things to my ps4 and ps5 in the past and actually thing has made my DualShock 4 buttons stop working at times.

Have a friend shoot water at the enemies while you use shock for a devastating effect.

Combine protection and fire together to make fire enemies give you tremendous health whenever they use fire attacks.

PS5,vmy12c,(Rant) Battlefield 2042 is an embarrassment to PS5 and Gamers,"Finally got my hands on a PS5. One of the games jammed into the ""Fuck You, you know you're still gonna buy it...""-package I begrudgingly purchased was 'Battlefield 2042'. I've played the OG classics, Hardline was bad but playable, 1 was thin but fun &amp; V was a good time (loved the tanks!)... 2042 is an abomination. 

The menus are an absolute mess and navigating them gets me closer to having a seizure than any of the piss poor graphics ever could. Speaking of which, whoever OK'd the final rendering of this game should be excommunicated from the gaming industry and the artists themselves should really consider other work. So many glitches too...

The weapon selection is pathetic, you get more options at a Bed and Breakfast. The ability to swap attachments mid game is pretty sweet, but again who cares when there's only 7 guns in the game. The class system has potential, but the crap menu layout makes it super confusing to navigate and I just lose interest.  Why would you assign so many different buttons to navigate a damn menu? I feel like I'm trying to solve a Rubik's cube changing a weapon load out.

The maps are massive but designed almost as if they don't want you to use vehicles... And the vehicles! Why are there so few! And why are there fewer options than ever?! Weak sauce EA... Speaking of which... Fuck EA.

For a system that's supposed to afford endless possibility, I feel really handcuffed to a style of play that just isn't fun in a game that doesn't even feel rushed, feels incomplete. Was really looking forward to a new Battlefield but I'm trading this in for whatever they'll give me. 

Says it all that they had to ham-hand it into package deals. Thankfully it included Elden Ring too. That way I can play a game designed by people vested in providing their customers with a quality product. Fuck EA, their brand killing greed &amp; shitty products.",,1656450779

The game is smooth like butter. It took my one death to feel like I'd been playing for hours. The atmosphere of the game is amazing. I was getting some nice Lovecraft feels from it. It only took a few days to raise i wasn't going to finish it, I'm not usually a fan of roguelikes, but I have PS plus, so it was free. I little tidbits of plot the game gave me left me very intrigued so I hit up YouTube for a plot explanation video and that's when it really killed the game for me. 

Spoilers past this point. 

&gt;!Ok so the entire time I was getting those Lovecraft vibes I was excited. I was picturing some ancient evil awakening, some nether God that drove all the beings on the planet insane. Totally hooked. !&lt;

&gt;!Then I find out the whole things is in her head because she feels guilty for inadvertently causing the death of her daughter and being unable to save her. I felt ripped off. I wanted deities of unimaginable horrer psychically decimating every kind on a planet and delving further and further into the mental apocalypse that was there home...!&lt;

So yeah, that's why it sucks and it's entirely on me. Because my dumb ass wanted something other than what I got...",,1656427639

PS5,vm0u6i,Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring.,"This is obviously my opinion so just keep that in mind.  


I've been a PlayStation first player since the early PS3-era, when the platform / first party was in the dumpster, and I was having lunch-time arguments in 8th grade about the merits of Folklore / Lair, over the likes of Gears of War and Bioshock...so in case anyone wants to question my bonafides there ya go.  


# Sony's 1st party output is getting predictable and boring, and Ghost of Tsushima / Horizon are not nearly as good as you all say they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Some would claim that this started with the success of Uncharted and The Last of Us, but those games are phenomenal, and completely unlike the string of boring, predictable, safe, focus-tested, lifeless first-party exclusives they've come out with in the last several years.   


Horizon Zero Dawn  
Days Gone  
Ghost of Tsushima  
Horizon Forbidden West  
These games are all extremely similar structurally. Open worlds with lots of icons, objectives, gameplay variation...most of them have stealth grass, crafting, stealth kills, special melee finishers, loot, gear upgrades, skill trees, weapon upgrades...the list of familiar gameplay mechanics goes on and on. If you take away the window dressing of ""Samurai game"" or ""Robot dinosaur game"" or ""Zombie game"", they are almost identical in their design and gameplay, which is THE most important thing.

There are so many missions in Ghost that are trailing missions, or following footsteps...only to have a bunch of Mongol's be put in your way...you dispatch them and then the mission is usually over.

Horizon, despite having extremely awkward jumping and platforming, insists on making the player play dozens of missions that focus almost solely around jumping and platforming. Climbing on pre-determined, auto-win paths is not fun...it was the worst part of Uncharted and now it's in every Sony game. You want to see a game that did it right? Breath of The Wild...and I know that Guerrilla knows this game exists because they stole the glider mechanic straight from it.  


# Just because a game has a lot of dialogue and cutscenes doesn't mean the story / characters are good.

Aloy is one of the most insufferable game protagonists to come around in a long time. She is rude, humorless, talks down to people constantly, has no respect for the people around her, and worst of all she never shuts up or lets the player just play the game. I'd be rich if I had a quarter every time Aloy told a villager essentially, ""Shut up and let me handle this situation you toothless hillbilly...IF I HAVE TIME"". Who wants to play a game where the main character is an asshole to everyone?  


Jin Sakai, while not as much of an asshole as Aloy, is boring and bland as hell. He's conflicted about samurai vs ninja, but no matter what you do in the game, your choices don't matter and he ends up becoming a ninja anyway. Outside of being conflicted...what other terms would you use to describe Jin?  


Don't get me wrong - I think gaming is in a stronger place now than it's been in a long time, but god some of these games are so boring it makes my head spin.",,1656350691

Sometimes you just need help. But often times making a new post isn't needed. For the time being, around launch and perhaps in the future. We will use a single thread for helping each other out.

Before asking, we ask you to look at a few links. Some question can't be answered and only official PlayStation support can help you.

PS5,vkqso8,Don't get ripped off,"My wife had been wanting for me to get a PS5 for a while and I refuse to pay scalpers so I decided to wait until plenty titles had been released and I had all the games to play when I got mine eventually. It was our anniversary and Father's day recently so she kept mentioning trying to get one. We signed up for the Playstation website list and Amazon list about a week ago. No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase. 

I hope you guys get your PS5 too!",,1656198216

The setup for the PS5 was wonky and didn't work for me. So I ended up getting the Pulse 3D at launch. The Mic is fine on that but nothing good. You get what you pay for at $100 truth be told. Works fine. I have tried the SteelSeries 7p+ ($170), just to have everything in the background comes through. Recently tried the SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless ($350), Just to sound low in my opinion unless I cranked it up in settings. Which allows more background noise to appear. Once again not practical to me. Without waiting for the PS5 version of Astros to drop. Which could be another year or two. 

Is there anything remotely good currently? That blocks out the background noise and only allows in your voice basically? Or close to it? The Pulse does a decent good job, but given the mic is built in, I sound like shit compared to the A40s or the Nova Pro Wireless.",,1656159821

* can to accounts play online games at the same time?
(and can you join games on the other PS5 like minecraft or does the world need to be shared?   Can you invite the other account to play in games like Fortnite?)

* do both PS5s have access to the same saves?

I have sub-accounts set up for all the kids.   I know when they use the PS4 under the same account as the PS5 that use will get logged out of the other console.)

PS5,vj1x32,"Ape Escape 2 is a mess on PS5, but why I have hope it will be fixed","So far the library of PS1 and PS2 is sparse. And personally I have no interest in the PS3 library through PS+ because my internet does not have the speeds to handle it. But if you have played Ape Escape 2 you'll notice a few things, that one it's the version that was ported to PS4 years ago when they did a short list of PS2 games for the PS4 early on the PS4's life. And two, it's broken on PS5 and they acknowledge that with a warning when you boot the game up which says to me that Sony knows that it's messed up on PS5. 

But why did I have hope they'll fix it? Because as said, the PS2 games that are on the service right now are the porter PS5 versions. For example Okage is the PS4 ported version dated from 2016. If you see the Jak and Daxter games they are also from the PS4 collection that was released awhile back. Unlike something like Ape Escape (the PSX original) that is dated for 6/13/22 here in the states, released again for this service. So I think that any further PS2 releases for PS+ will released for their service specifically, and again not like the few games they ported a few years ago on PS4. I think they'll fix Ape Escape 2 once they actually start getting to the PS2 games which will probably come with things like save states etc like we've seen with the PS1 titles.

And hopefully we'll finally get a rerelease of Ape Escape 3 since they rated it again back in 2020, but didn't release anything.",,1656004414

PS5,vj0w5i,"PS1 and PSP games free, while PS2 and PS3 games not","Hello everyone, today the new PlayStation Plus subscription came out in Italy and with it also the (few) PS1, PSP, PS2 and PS3 games in emulation.

Now guys, that's all well and good, I don't want to blurt out on the PlayStation Plus topic, really I swear I'm okay with literally everything and everyone has their own opinion about it....but, holy HELL, but will you please explain to me what is the point of giving us """"""free"""" PS1 AND PSP games purchased digitally at the time, while PS2 AND PS3 games are not? I swear to you guys, I feel taken for a ride in an unbelievable way.

Either they were doing it for all consoles or not at all, but I say what's the point of doing it like this, half-heartedly, just for the content to make people feel good?

I am dumbfounded, I repeat I'm really okay with anything, 120$  a year for two games in a cross TO ME IS OK, everyone can choose whether to do it or not, no one is obligated....but there is a f\*cking limit to the transparency a company can have, and this is really one of the most treacherous and disgusting moves I've ever seen.

And don't tell me ""if you want to play PS2 and PS3 games you bought on the Store at the time get yourself a PS3"" because that's not the point, the point is the disrespect towards their fanbase, the wanting to take advantage of every last penny.

PS5,vht4f4,"I should love Far Cry 6, but I kind of hate it.","Far Cry 6 has a fun story and the characters are pretty excellent. There is a lot of heart in Far Cry 6's narrative, but the open world has no real soul, and the UI feels sluggish and dated.

Simply put, the things you do in the open world and how you are meant to traverse it--are monotonous. We all know what Ubisoft games are like so there's no need to go into great detail here.

I want to talk briefly about the UI.

When you start the game, you always get a voiced menu-narrator that says ""Press cross to start"" or something like that. At first it's like, cool accessibility. But you never have the option of turning it off. That's a little thing though, right?

But once you're in the game you start seeing those lazy design choices like having to enter the pause menu every time you want to switch your supremo device. Or having to drag your cursor around the menu screen to select things like you're playing with a mouse and keyboard. Or having to enter the pause menu again if you want to dismiss your companion.

What annoys me most though is how the main character can only grab certain ledges in the game. I frequently find myself stand right next to a fence or stairwell or rock that I can't climb because the game wants me to find the yellow painted wall that I'm allowed to climb to reach an item or vantage point. This is just egregious and a huge step back as far as modern open world games are concerned.

This game feels like such a contrast to Far Cry 5 which I feel had a really good balance of open world distractions and mission design; I was never really bored with Far Cry 5. (Hopefully it gets a console update).

I know this is all over the place.

TL/DR: Far Cry 6 is a waste of time.",,1655861475

PS5,vhr2bl,My Replacement PS5 - A LONG Journey,"So. Back in June 2021 I was lucky enough to get myself a PS5 (disc version) console for RRP without really trying that hard if I'm honest.

Flash forward from June 2021 to May of this year. The 12th to be exact. A day that will haunt me.

I had just installed Evil Dead The Game (E/D) and the new PS5 firmware update - like many people had I assume.

20 mins into E/D and the PS5 screen went black, an almighty ""scream"" type audio rumbled out of the speakers on my TV and the PS5 went off.

""Okay. That was weird. Damn game.""

Turned it back on and loaded E/D back up again. 

4 or 5 minutes later...

Green screen. PS5 powers off.

""What a dogsh** game!""

Threw the game back in the cupboard and put (I'm ashamed to say) Fortnite on. Played for 2 or 3 hours. No issues. 

A couple of days pass, maybe a week, during which I'm discussing E/D with some mates and how annoying it is that the game is unplayable.

""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Mine doesn't crash."" ""I've not had any problems.""

Not what I wanted to hear.

I do a bit of research. 

'PS5 green screen....' comes back with issues ranging from software, HDMI leads popping out or a bad GPU.

I keep telling myself that it was the game - Fortnite was okay. No issues at all. I decided I'm going to test it out again. I don't even get past E/Ds loading screen this time. Green screen. Power off.

I reset the console. Same issue.
I option 7 the console. Same issue.

ONLY with E/D.

I'm playing Far Cry 6, Valhalla, Fortnite, all without issue.

To be on the safe side I contact Sony through their online portal. 

I ask them outright if the firmware has caused this. Knowing a few people have had firmware issues previously.

They tell me to send it back if I like because it ""might"" be broken. Even though I'm playing it. 

""What!?""

They give me a case number. Let's say 666X666 and instructions on how to package my PS5 for return. (I'm in the UK - They give you a label and nothing else.)

There's no way it's broken though. I'm playing it whilst reading their email. How can they say it might not work when I'm literally playing it?

Flash another week. It's playing everything except E/D.

June 10th 2022. Or as I now call it. 

Sony PlayStation Fried-day.

It's 0830 and I just got in from a night shift. Figured I'd do some looting and shooting before bed so I turn it on. Fortnite loads because I want something easy.

30 seconds later. Green screen. Power off. Reboot. 30 seconds. The same. Reboot. 20 seconds. Black screen. (That's new). Power off.

I pull the leads out. Use a whole roll of bubble wrap and mail the PS5 at 1032 in the morning. Gone. 

When Sony give you your case number they also give you a link to track your return. That evening, just because I'm bored I type in 666X666 and my postcode. 

[In transit to us.]

Cool. 

I then check Royal Mail tracking who confirmed the same.

What follows is a breakdown of what happend next.

11th [In transit to us]
13th [In transit to us]
14th [You do not have access to view this page] 

I figured that was an error but I was away for a couple of days so wasn't spending hours on the phone sorting it out. Fired them a quick email anyway. 

Royal Mail told me it was delivered to the distribution centre but that's as far as their tracking goes because Sony then use a different service.

16th [You do not have access to view this page]

I had no choice but to call the number I got from Twitter.

Gave them all my details. Explained I'd been locked out of tracking to be told they'd received my unit on the 11th. So the tracking was wrong anyway. It was now at the repair centre and would be back with me in 14 - 21 days. Even though the website says 15 max. Okay fine. Doesn't bother me. I work a lot anyway.

17th June 2022 I received an email asking me to rate the service I'd received and informing me my PS5 was yet to be received but they'd keep in touch. I was confused. The person on the phone said they'd received it at the repair centre on the 11th. Now 6 days later they don't have it? 

Obviously I call them again to be told I don't exist. Not my tracking number. Me. They've no record of ever speaking to me via the phone or emails. Luckily I screen capped the emails which I promptly sent over.

18th June I get two emails telling me;

*Your PS5 has been received and the repairs team are working on it. 

*Your PS5 is still in transit to the repair centre.

I can't call them because the call centre is closed Sat and Sun - so I send back a very polite email explaining I will call them first thing Monday the 20th June and I want to know WTF is happening.

20th June and I give them a ring. I'm INSTANTLY put through to a manager. They don't even ask. They just tell me they're doing it as soon as I say who I am.

I explain that I'm fine with it taking 14 - 21 days - it doesn't bother me. I just want proper confirmation they have it as so far I've been told it's not there, it is there, I don't exist... etc

The manager tells me the following... 

""We recieved the console this morning at the distribution centre. It will be sent to the repairs centre today and you will have it back by the 28th June.""

Awesome. I thank him, hang up the phone and go about my day. 

1656 on the same day I receive an email...

""We are pleased we could assist you and are now closing your case.""

Closing the case? You've still got my console. I think not.

I try to call but they close at 1700 apparently. 

21st June 2022 I'm straight on the phone. 

The woman tells me that I received my console at 1029 that morning (yesterday). ""The f*** I have...""

She goes off to get a manager who spends the next twenty minutes calling me a liar and saying they have a signature, proof of delivery, etc etc 

I ask them to forward me an email containing all of this information and tell them I will be in London that afternoon, at their office to show them my security footage from my house.

Suddenly the manager says...

""Oh. Sorry. Your console will be there today between 1330 and 1530"".

I'm still angry from being called a liar and say;

""I still want the proof of delivery you have from 1029 this morning though. Ya know. My signature. A photo. Whatever it was you have there in front of you...""

He hung up.

1525 Brand new, replacement PS5 - in a brown box (no PS5 box) turns up and I don't even have to sign for it because the DPD drivers machine isn't working.

I genuinely believe that they knew the firmware messed it up, they had it on the 11th, they then lost it between the 12th and 14th and thought I wouldn't check - locking me out of tracking intentionally, didn't want to repair it and finally I think if I hadn't have caused such a fuss I believe they would still be maintaining I'd got it back even when I hadn't.

TLDR 

PS5 Blew up. Sony lost it. Claims I had it back when I didn't and had proof. Only when I mentioned my home security did they say otherwise. Replaced the console in a rubbish brown box.",,1655855242

PS5,vge2xl,PSA for PS premium subscribers: jak 3 is (technically) broken,"so as we all know, sony released the new ps plus tiers recently. and as we also know, the classics catalog is extremely barebones, which is disappointing. the ps2 catalog literally has only 4 games in it, and those are the jak and daxter games. ok sweet, those are some cool classics, and one of sony's most beloved mascot platformers. so with the lack of other ps2 games on the catalog, you'd think that sony would have done everything to make sure that these games are delivered to us in the most utmost condition right? WRONG! 

for those of you who decide to start paying 120 bucks per year, you need to know that this game cannot be platinumed for a large quantity of players, on both ps4 and ps5. trophies come with all 4 jak games, so they're clearly an advertised feature of the new ps plus service. well, this is just to let you know that many players out there, including myself, cannot get the platinum trophy because the game is glitched. 

if you attempt to platinum the game, you need to obtain all 600 precursor orbs, the primary collectible in the game, and ofc this has a couple trophies tied to it. problem is that gaining all of these is impossible for some people. there are numerous side challenges in the game that do not award their orbs upon completion. I finished doing the wasteland run race today, and despite beating the gold medal requirement, I wasnt awarded with any trophies for the challenge. i've tried replaying it numerous times, to no avail. and this isn't the only challenge that awards orbs either. im currently at 576/200 orbs and im a hundred percent positive that i've done everything that im supposed to do for all the other orbs. i've found all the collectible ones via youtube guides, and i've gotten all the orbs related to the various in-game mini games. but it would seem that some challenges do not properly give you the orbs, most notably the races. my high score tab in the pause menu has shown me clearing every single gold medal time for every challenge, and yet im still short on 24 orbs. for some people it might be slightly less, and for some slightly more. nobody knows what the issue is for sure because neither sony nor naughty dog have ever fixed this issue.

the game is currently running on version 1.02, and it doesnt appear to be possible to delete the game and attempt to play it on version 1.00, since you need to be connected to the internet to redownload the game, and doing so prompts you to download the most recent update as well, which presumably broke progression. it was originally released in 2017 as part of the jak and daxter bundle, and even now in 2022 this has not been fixed. for those who bought it digitally, this was already insulting, but the fact that sony chose to voluntarily put these games onto their new premium service which they're charging people for, just for them to find out that they cant obtain the platinum either, is a whole new level of disrespectful. you'd think that with the ps2 catalog being as pathetic as it is, they would have done everything in their power to polish these emulated games as much as possible. there have been numerous other threads made on reddit regarding this issue, but nothing was ever done. 

my hope is that this post can bring some awareness to this issue and get sony to release a new update for it, since they're essentially charging for an advertised feature that doesnt work properly for a lot of people. there are NO missable collectibles in jak 3, but some of them definitely are glitched, and need to be fixed ASAP, because this reflects poorly on sony.",,1655703584

PS5,vft0mb,Is there a way to tell if a controller was sold with the console or separately,"Hello everyone, I have a little problem that haunted me even when I was playing on my PS4. The left thumb stick started drifting around 2 weeks ago and I know way too well that's it's going to become worse. I am not looking for solutions, I tried resetting it and all and I'm not going to unscrew everything in order to fix it because I still have the warranty.

Since I have the warranty there shouldn't be a problem but the store I bought the console will ask me to send the PS5 too. I do find to be an annoying process and I would prefere to send only the controller.

My plan is to buy a controller from the same store and switch the controllers but I don't know if there is any way for anyone to see if I switched them or not.",,1655637553

PS5,vfsynb,Activity Cards are still poorly implemented.,"We are 20 months into the console generation and the biggest ""innovation"" that came with PS5's new UI, the activity cards, are still wasted potential.

They seemed like such a cool feature pre-launch. Jumping in your save file right from the home screen rather than having to go through the game's main menu? Yes please!
Offering tips and tricks for when you get stuck or want to unlock a trophy? Awesome.
And so much more...

But let's be real, who actually uses them?

I think there are two main issues that need to be fixed ASAP:

1. Visibility: when you press the home button mid game the activity cards will immediatly pop up. That's great. But how about when you view the game from the home screen? E.g. in order to select the activity card that boots you right into your most recent save file. Well, you actually have to press downwards twice on the controller. That's terrible. You won't even be seeing the avtivity cards unless you actively seek them out. So I personally forget to use them most of the time eventhough I could boot into the game much faster.

2. Consistency: there is zero consistency between games. Is there an activity card for loading my most recent save? Are there activity cards with tips and tricks? How do these activity cards look like? I simply don't know. Because of that I can never build muscle memory like ""pressing down and square will always launch the activity card that boots my most recent save"". Instead I always have to search for the card I'm looking for... if it even exists that is.

Possible solution: Sony need to make a few mandates that all new games will have to follow. The most important one in my opinion is that there has to be a Resume activity card that boots you right into your save file. This card also has to be the first card you see when selecting a game from the home screen. Secondly Sony need to rework their UI to make it more easy to understand at a glance what an activity card does and they need to make it easier to view and select an activity card from the home screen. They should probably go even further and include a hotkey that will immediatly load your save file. E.g. loading your most recent save directly from the home screen by pressing the square button.

What are your thoughts?",,1655637325

PS5,vfjrup,Elden Ring Bosses' song lyrics are not in any language and thus cannot be translated [ Info offiacially confirmed] Read attentively till the end.," Salve. I am a Latin student and I have been studying all Elden Ring choral songs.

The first one I analysed was 'song of lament, not a boss theme, (aka song of the bats) whose lyrics are indeed in Latin. I contacted the lyricist who wrote them 3 months ago and then (for my surprise) I was told that only those were written by that person. Then I published those Latin lyrics and their translation at the time (Games from Mars channel got them from me and thus fairly credited me in his video) and I was looking forward to finding another Latin song in Elden Ring. 

For that purpose,  I contacted some music producers who worked in Elden Ring and they confirmed that 99% of the lyrics in the game are not in any language at all and don't mean anything. 

I have recently published some of my conversations with them on r/eldenringdiscussion by the way.

The Elden Ring music producers explained that the lyrics were computer generated and adjusted to sound like ancient languages.

 In order to help my research on the use of random syllables to simulate ancient languages in game songs, I was given the official lyrics and I have been analysing them carefully. Check out Mohg's official lyrics for example:   [https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI](https://youtu.be/fgM8HZRRvoI)  

As you could see, some times the lyrics resemble Latin, but they are not in Latin. The goal was to simulate ancient languages songs to enhance the dramatic feel of the player's experience.

I know it may be frustrating to know about it, but I was told that process is quite common in video games actually.

Sadly a wave of fake news last week about 'translations' of Elden Ring Bosses song lyrics spread pretty fast. I talked to youtuber Vaati and (fortunately) he is aware those are fake translations. So be careful, let your ears know 99% of Elden Ring song lyrics are computer generated syllables created to simulate ancient languages songs.

My girlfriend and I game share from my account and a few of the games I own on disc are now available here, like Miles Morales.

Since game sharing would require her to download Miles' digital version from my account in order to play it, I was wondering, does having both the physical and digital versions of a game tied to an account cause issues of any kind?

PS5,vetkyv,So.... I'm the only one whose PS5 started overheating about a month ago?????,"About a month ago a message popped up on my screen notifying me that my PS5 was getting too hot and needed to be powered off. It was in fact a little dusty so I cleaned it, thinking that was for sure the issue. But now it seems that when I play a PS5 game for an extended period of time it displays this same message. And I have to power it off or it will force shutdown. I got on YouTube to see what the problem could be. That's when I noticed there are a lot of other people that are having this exact same issue. Which started about a month ago or so. Some think a software update caused this issue. I'm frustrated because I visit PS5 reddit page a lot to see what's new.. and to generally stay informed about things. But I haven't really seen any posts about PS5's overheating. What's really going on??

Also... I have had my PS5 since launch day. Never had this issue until about a month ago. Was playing NBA 2k22 last night and got the over heating message before halftime.... Playing 6 minute quarters. Something isn't right..",,1655510231

Anyways, [here's a link to the album for it.](https://imgur.com/a/3WRBaSG) If you've ever removed the side panels to install an SSD, the process is exactly the same. If you haven't, it's pretty simple: Unscrew the base, pull up from the top corner and push towards the bottom of the console and it'll come off cleanly. It takes a bit more force than you might expect. Then you just slide the new ones in. It comes with instructions if you aren't sure how it goes.",,1655509322

I was wondering it would be cool to see some smaller titles for a change from them. No need to think is this good for wide audience, just experiment and go wild!

People have expectations when they see Naughty Dog logo  in a teaser trailer. Many would laught their asses of if they see something ""indie"" from them.

How about new, smaller studio that would cycle people between projects? Small platformer made by people from Naughty Dog and Insomniac games? Puzzle game made by Sucker Punch and San Diego studio? And so on...

I know it is stupid to think they just let people go at the same time they hire, and it would be smarter to just build new ""indie"" studio with new talent to focus on simple games. But it would be cool to see what kind of games all talented people at Playstation Studios could create together while having fun.

And to be clear, I love God Of War, Uncharted, and many other big budget game. Just some thoughts. :)",,1655491909

Prices are pretty reasonable for gen3 m.2 these days so it wouldn't be outrageous to get a 1tb and enclosure. At the same time I could probably get a 2tb sata for about the same price, but that is only about 4Gbps, so missing out on a lot of speed.

My friends have speeds of up to 300Mbps while paying the same price as me

Are there any non-fixed providers in Australia or am I forced to pay $200 a month for a meer 100Mbps download speed?

If anyone can shine some light on this I'd really appreciate it as I can't find anything about it online",,1655438111

PS5,ve1twl,Looking for a PS5 game with infinite replayability,"Greetings,

As per the title, I am looking for PS5 game recommendations that I can play forever without ""completing"" it.  What I mean by that is games like Civilization, Stardew Valley, driving/racing like Mario Kart or Crash Team Racing, etc. I'd also prefer it to be a offline and solo game.

The idea is to be able to have one game I can always count on to be there; to be able to play without having it be one of those games where you finish the story and you're basically done with it. Even if its a dumb long RPG game like Soulsbourne or ElderScrolls games because eventually I could run through the game with each class/build. By infinite I truly mean infinite to no end. 

I'd prefer it to be a laid back/relax after a long day of work type of game.  Turn based would be nice or a chill adventure type thing like stardew where there is no pressure to commit so much attention for a long period of time, itd be nice to get up and move a bit here and there. Like getting up between races on mario kart or between days on stardew, in between turns on a turn based game.

I know it's a lot but my dream is to find this game that can satisfy my gaming itch no matter when it comes up.",,1655431117

PS5,vdzaq6,I Feel Like the New PS Plus Is Not Good Value for Money,"Hello everyone,

¬£10.99 for ""Essentials"" is a bit much, especially as you have to pay an extra ¬£3 to access classics under premium at ¬£13.99. 

A lot of people are raving about 400 games!!! But it's 2022. Most of these games are dirt-cheap now and you can buy a PS3 for around ¬£60 with games on Ebay. 

Incidentally, I also feel the same about Xbox Gamepass - in that most games are dirt-cheap. Except they at least include EA, backward compatible catalog of original Xbox, 360 and Xbox One games for the same as Essentials at ¬£10.99.

I know it's early days, but I don't believe in subscription based game passes. You'll argue, ""no one is forcing you to buy it"", but it has serious ramifications for the industry as a whole. It demotivates developers, subscription prices ALWAYS rise regardless of the economy, so you end up paying more. It's very telling that PS didn't even attempt to undercut Microsoft's Gamepass or factor in rising costs....hubris? I don't know.",,1655423083

I did read that they won‚Äôt be releasing their 1st party games to it at least at launch which is okay in my opinion, but do they have plans to release them there let‚Äôs say a year after the release date? 

I am also curious what you all think they will release there in the future as well as what you hope they release there, for me personally I hope they release Dreams on it at the very least. 

I know they aren‚Äôt going to try to directly compete with Microsoft in this area but still what do you think the overall goal of it will be as well as the quality of PS5 games that they will bring to it. 

I just upgraded myself for death stranding, demon souls, and also to try the cyberpunk demo, and I will try a few of the others I don‚Äôt have, but I do have all of the PS5 games on the list besides those two. 

Do you think we will get PS5 games every month or will it just be PS4 and old PS3 games being added, as well as Indie games?",,1655398933

For some more insight as to what I would like to achieve...

I plan on playing daily. Not interested I competitive online gaming at the moment. Depending on how I feel down the line I might try and pretend like I'm a pro. I don't care about story modes or season modes. I strictly plan on playing where I can collect/level up/trade/buy/sell/unlock players to improve my team. I have no issues with spending some money towards q game I will enjoy, I will not invest my life savings just to be able to have a good team that can be competitive. 

Please note, I currently own both games and have played a few matches of both games. In eFootball I focus on Dream Team and Fifa 22 I focus on FUT. I like the slower gameplay of eFootball more so than Fifa, but it is completely barebones as hell when it comes to any sort of customization and there is no marketplace to sell players. Fifa on the other hand looks way better, has better presentation and plenty of customization options including a market place. However the game feels to fast paced and the marketplace to me implies more money needed to be spent. I like aspects of both games, ideally if I could combine them to make 1 game I would. 

With that being said, short term and long term, overall, which game would you focus more on completely? I don't want to be bouncing between both. Based on what I've described and based on your own opinion/experience. 

Cheers",,1655389933

I've also been tempted to buy the new horizon zero dawn game but been waiting for more patches and I'm glad I waited cuz I read the game has been patched alot and even fixed the performance mode option for it and considering vrr just came out not to long ago im looking forward to playing that and demon souls on my lg oled c1 and yes I know it's not the full game of forbidden west but the game trial should hold me over till I decide to purchase and I also wanted to buy the new WWE 2k game but been hesitant so I'm excited that we get game trials now. prolly gonna save me a ton of money down the road anyways I'm gonna have a busy month while I'm off work with gaming",,1655358052

I recently got a soundbar, but I have been noticing some lag between the audio and video. It looks like the sound comes in delayed. I made a posting on r/Soundbars but I figured it might be a good idea to post here too since I'm using my PS5, maybe someone knows how to fix my issue.

Here is my hardware setup:

PS5 connected to [Samsung TV's](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-55-class-7-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-tizen-tv/6401735.p?skuId=6401735) HDMI via stock HDMI cable

TV eARC HDMI port connected to [Samsung soundbar's](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/home-theater/sound-bars/hw-b650-3-1ch-soundbar-w-dolby-5-1-dts-virtual-x-2022-hw-b650-za/) ARC port (not eARC)

Here are the things I've tried:

The first thing I tried was using the optical cable. The manual does say to use a hi speed HDMI w/ Ethernet and I just grabbed some random, generic HDMI that came with a monitor I bought recently for my PC. That did not resolve the issue, audio lag was the same

My original setup was PS5 stock HDMI into Soundbar HDMI and then soundbar ARC HDMI to TV eARC so basically everything going through the soundbar, but that capped my PS5's resolution to 1080p which made the picture really crisp because it's a 4K TV, but everything was way over saturated and there were noticeable artifacts on the screen. I'm not sure if this was a limitation of the soundbar being ARC and the TV being eARC or if there were some settings I had to tinker with on both TV and PS5 but I didn't bother because originally I thought I was using it wrong having it hooked up like that

I tried audio sync on my TV, but that didn't seem to do anything, and audio sync on the sound bar only made it worse, and it was already set to 0. I thought there might be negative values like on the TV settings, but there weren't it only went from 0 to like 200 

I saw somewhere that switching to DTS Virtual X helps with latency but that didn't help with my situation.

I also went into my TV's expert settings and changed the audio output to Pass-Through (other options are PCM and Auto).

On the PS5 I also have audio options for PCM, Dolby and DTS. I saw somewhere that Dolby would be the best if I'm using ARC, but that didn't fix the issue. I did see a marginal improvement, but it was minimal, and the lag is still very apparent",,1655318497

PS5,vcxeh4,PS2 Classics still 50 hz PAL versions in North American territories?,"For some reason my previous post was reported and removed. I think there may have been some confusion as to what I was claiming, so I would like to clarify: **PS1 Classics on the new PS Plus Premium service are the original 60hz NTSC versions in North American territories.** This is good.

**However, PS2 Classics are still the 50hz PAL versions for me when I download them onto my NTSC PS5.** This is not good. A notable example is Ape Escape 2, which is very clearly the PAL version as evidenced by the game's splash screen displaying [""Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Presents""](https://i.imgur.com/2MWrRj0.jpg).

[I'm also experiencing graphical glitches with the HUD](https://i.imgur.com/wqv74KL.jpg), which I also encountered last year when I first tried booting up this specific title on my PS5.

Basically, it would seem **Sony has not updated their PS2 Classic titles for PS Plus Premium, only the PS1/PSP Classic titles.** This isn't conjecture on my part, but a fact for me at least (N=1). I'm curious if anyone else has been impacted by this same issue. If not then perhaps Sony is rolling out NTSC updates for PS2 Classic titles in a staggered manner.",,1655307694

PS5,vcw685,"I don‚Äôt have a PS5 yet, how does the DRM work?","I‚Äôm specifically wondering about the backwards compatibility. 

If your PS5 is completely offline and you put in a PS4 disc and let it install, can you run the game without having to connect to the internet? I only ask because when you put an Xbox One game into a Series X, it has to be connected to the internet to finish the install. I‚Äôm assuming this has to do with you having to have the latest game patch installed for proper compatibility. So does this same issue exist on PS5?

I should clarify that I‚Äôm not talking about the free upgrades to games, but simply playing a PS4 game on PS5. 

If somebody who owns a PS5 could check this for me, I‚Äôd be really thankful as I haven‚Äôt been able to find the answer I‚Äôm looking for online.",,1655304379

Ape Escape 2 is notably bad, with graphical glitches galore.

Just managed to acquire a PS5 after a year of trying. I have a few games in my library from when I had as PS4 a couple of years ago and I'm going to subscribe to PS Plus Extra as soon as it launches in the UK.
On my Xbox there's a Trueachievements app that is integrated into the Xbox achievements system where you can click on an ancient and get guides, advice etc on how to get the achievements.
Is there an equivelent on PlayStation?

I read there are still not many games out yet.

I have a PS4 pro that works perfectly, I keep thinking, if it is time to upgrade.

Then I think, why bother. If I didn't have a Pro, or it broke, then it would make sense, but as it is I'll keep my pro.

Maybe there are a few players who still have both set up. What are your thoughts?",,1655293069

PS5,vcrm4h,Sony needs to add LFC (low framerate compensation)!,"Yeah just tried a little bit of the Resident Evil 2 PS5 Patch and I have that game on both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 and it‚Äôs really obvious that the PS5 has no LFC. The framerate in the raytracing mode often falls under 48 fps and on PS5 that creates clearly visible and distracting stuttering. The Xbox version also falls unter 48fps (from my limited analysis via the VRR information on my LG CX I would say they are the same performance wise, where PS5 falls under 48 fps and shows 59hz in VRR into Xbox is around 90 ¬± 3 fps in the info which makes it around 43-44 fps due to frame doubling) but because LFC is working it‚Äôs doubling frames and it‚Äôs much MUCH more smoother experience on Xbox. 

It‚Äôs a little but frustrating because I really would like to play 2 and 3 on PlayStation 5 (because I‚Äôm weird and Resident Evil are ‚ÄúPlaystation Games‚Äù in my head, also DualSense!) but in this case Series X is clearly the much better experience. 

I really hope Sony adds system wide LFC. I know developers can add an own implementation of LFC similar to what insomniac did in Spider-Man but I believe it would help especially for third party developers to implement it an a system level.

PS5,vcpeuw,Here's a list of most of the Playstation Plus Extra titles sorted by Metacritic Review,"Not all titles have on Playstation Plus Extra have reviews so I've excluded those particular games. Also, not all of the games have 4 or more reviews, in that instance I just took an average or used a different platform's review.

Hope some people find this useful, there's some titles in there that I'd never heard of that have pretty decent reviews. Also, it's worth noting that a lot of these games are quite old and might not have scored as highly by today's standards, so KNACK is probably more of a 95 than a 100.

It seems a bit too good to be true. On his side is the pictures he has, the fact he's willing to let me open the box and packaging, the fact that he has tons of positive reviews on kijiji (and very few negative ones about things like negotiation, which makes his reviews seem authentic), and that on his account he's selling a bunch of different gaming and electronic products, and his account is 2 years old and he's shown me a screenshot of an order confirmation for the bundle he's selling (so I can get warranty on the product in question), and that he wants to meet me in person and apparently has a very nice Mercedes (not too relevant but it adds to the fact that he seems like a well to do guy).

Only problem is I look at ebay and stockx and most ps5s are going for 950-1100 even without an extra controller (though some have horizon forbidden west bundled). 

Is this guy a scammer? Is he going to sell me a box of bricks or a bricked ps5?",,1655253731

PS5,vch3xi,I Miss the Old Era of Game Conferences," I feel like since COVID (and a few years before tbh) gaming presentations have felt so dry and stale. Whether its a State of Play, Summer Games Fest, The Game Awards, or even the Xbox Bethesda Showcase, I feel as if these have lost the magic they used to have. Obviously the pandemic has played a role, but the days of live audience reactions to a surprise announcement during E3 seem to be over and that makes me sad. For example, I think Sony's E3 2016 press conference is probably the all-time best gaming showcase/conference/show ever. It completely exceeded anyone's expectations, there were very few leaks, the theatricality of the show itself with the orchestra going into a LIVE 15 minute demo of God of War (2 years before it even came out!!). Could you imagine a showcase now showing a live 15 minute demo of a game 2 years before release now?? Not to mention the other great moments, like an exclusive Spider-Man game, the reveal of Resident Evil 7 being a first person survival horror game that no one knew was The Kitchen demo months before, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, Crash Bandicoot coming back, giving a date for The Last Guardian, Kojima literally walking out on stage and showing Death Stranding for the first time before anyone knew what it was. Bottom line, this conference was just full of surprises and amazing moments and I just don't think something like this will ever happen again, especially now with everyone doing direct-style formats for their presentations. Maybe it's just me but I've always enjoyed the live shows with an audience much more than these dry, corporate directs that everyone does now.",,1655251171

The voltage of the power brick is correct with a suitable usb-C cable that charges phones/switch etc. and when I plug it in it pulses orange, but it doesn't charge any more than when it was last used and the orange light lasts indefinitely (as opposed to turning off when fully charged). This is the same when the console is fully off, and when it's in rest mode. I've used multiple bricks and cables with the same result.

I can charge the controller when I'm playing, but only by turning it off, plugging it in, then turning it back on. This is the only way to get it to hold charge. I can also charge it via the USB on the console when it's in rest mode, but it's tricky to get the console so I prefer not to do this.

Anyone else had similar issues and found a solution? Never had any problem charging the ps4 controller from a wall socket, it's causing some issues not being able to do it with the ps5 as I don't sit near a plug or USB socket when I'm playing.

We'd been thinking about starting with the LEGO Skywalker Saga since it falls into our normal fan base. 

I had some new ideas today though with the release of the new tiers of PS Plus. I subscribed to the highest tier to check it out and noticed there were a lot of older PS3 era Disney games that could be fun to go back and mess around with on a live stream. I tried to do a test stream of Toy Story Mania only to find that since it's a stream game (no download option since PS5 can't emulate PS3 games) that you can't actual broadcast it using the built in PS5 hardware/software.

PS5,vb8dct,I got a PS5 directly from Sony that came defective. I had to send it back and they cannot replace it. Here are my thoughts about it.,"I got selected to buy a PS5. It came defective and I spent my whole weekend over the phone with Sony support to try and troubleshoot it, and hours on forums and watching YouTube videos to fix it. I legit had to **return** my PS5 and they couldn‚Äôt promise a replacement. I‚Äôm heartbroken, but here are my thoughts about the current generation consoles:

I became a PlayStation ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù when I got my PS4 Pro over the Xbox One X. Before that I only had Nintendo consoles. I grew up with the GameCube.

The reason I got a PS4 instead of an Xbox was because of the quality and exclusive games it had, the large user base, and Sony‚Äôs pro-consumer practices. Xbox One X barely had any notable exclusives and Microsoft was anti-gamer when the Xbox One first released. They had Halo, Forza, and Minecraft. Sony had God of War, Horizon, Spider-Man, The Last of Us, Uncharted, and more.

Now, the Xbox Series X is more powerful and has more memory than the PS5 at the same price. Microsoft went haywire with acquisitions and now boasts Starfield, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, DOOM, and more. The Xbox Series X also looks much better than the PS5, in my opinion. Microsoft has finally become pro-gamer once again but it seems like it‚Äôll probably dominate the gaming market in the long term. Microsoft vastly overpowers Sony.

So I‚Äôm stuck here, deciding whether or not I should get an Xbox Series X or a PS5. I want a 1 terabyte PS5 that isn‚Äôt massive it takes up a quarter of my TV stand. I‚Äôll also probably get it just to play God of War; but then again, most of these games are releasing on PC anyway.",,1655113368

Maybe a Midnight Club open world racing story-game focused on street races and violence? I also wouldn't mind a badass undercover cop game similar to Sleeping Dogs and a futuristic open world game that's even more futuristic than CyberPunk with flying cars and etc similar to Fifth Element.

PS5,vb7ka4,Recommended games for a someone known for not finishing games (Including backwards compatible)?,"So I have my PS5 for like 8 months now. So far I have played alot of FIFA, uncharted 1-3 and TLOU1. 

I have tried GOW and Uncharted 4 but somehow these didn‚Äôt stick with me and I have never finished them. 

Including the PS3/PS4 I haven‚Äôt finished alot of games. The ones I can think of are uncharted 1-3, AC2-revelations, TLOU1, GTA IV.

I like to get my moneys worth out of a game, so $60 for a 10h games just seems expensive for me. But when I play a 100h+ open world game I just get overwhelmed. I love a good world and an emotional roller coaster. Thats why I loved TLOU1. 

Including the PS4 games it looks like RDR2 would fit my needs but the open world scares me. TLOU1 is so nostalgic to me the mixed reviews of TLOU2 scare me. Elden Ring looks dope but I disliked the fighting mechanics in GOW (while I loved the world). 

This is starting to feel like a rant but I really want to gey away from the grindy FIFA/COD hours and wanna get invested in good story games but I dont know where to start üòÇ",,1655109813

PS5,vb54a1,PS5 VRR on Samsung QN90A - Color slightly off?,"Hello Reddit,

I recently got the PS5 and Samsung's QN90A. My tv supports HDMI 2.1 (4K 120FPS) and with one of the PS5‚Äôs latest updates, VRR on said PS5. However, and maybe I‚Äôm just crazy, I‚Äôve noticed that there is a slight change in color (or brightness?) when VRR is on vs off, and I‚Äôm not even talking about when you set it to 4K 120FPS VRR, which sets the color from RGB to YUV422.

A good example would be Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart. When VRR is turned off (Just 4K, RGB, 60FPS, &amp; HDR), the color really pops. His orange fur is really vibrant, and the shadow detail is really good. However, when I turn VRR on, the colors seem a bit subdued. Like Ratchet‚Äôs fur isn‚Äôt as vibrantly orange as it is when the VRR is off, and the shadows seem less dark. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but there is a definite, if slight, difference in the colors/shadows/(brightness?) when VRR is turned on or off while playing Ratchet and Clank, and even AstroBoy.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is this the nature of PS5 VRR or is there a setting I need to change on my TV or some third option?

Also, kind of related, can you see a difference between RGB and YUV422?",,1655099259

I recently started using the ""Remote Play"" feature, and have been controlling the PS5 via the PS4 Pro in the other room on the same network. Everything seems to be great so far. I also notice I have free download of the PS4 versions of the same games, so I figured I would install to see if there's any difference. Would the experience be better or worse to play the PS4 versions instead of doing remote play? I realize the PS4 Remote Play is being streamed wireless over the network, so there could be some type of input lag or something like that. Curious to get your opinions. Thanks!",,1655086137

Personally, I don't even really understand the point of gaming consoles anymore. To me, it seems like their time would be better spent developing gaming PCs with their own operating systems. It's not like the price is that far off anymore. Consoles are a very outdated idea and I think if they were smart, they would move on to another idea after this generation of consoles. Microsoft seems to be moving toward this direction as they implement their xbox game pass for PC. I'm not seeing Sony do much with PCs. Why are they still all in on console when a PC can play games the same as a console, while having all the other features of a computer.

But either way, having exclusive titles seems a little weird in this day, with so many other platforms and more and more people owning a PC than ever before, it just doesn't make any sense. Why would a developer choose to leave out everyone who doesn't use a PS5? Why are they leaving them out when other triple AAA developers are letting people use whatever platform they want to use. In fact, I can now play steam games and xbox game pass games using my phone and a bluetooth controller wherever I go. Sony is the only one that is stubbornly sticking to console and still accepting exclusives.

PS5,vargd1,[USA]K2/Sony are blocking The Quarry PS4 Standard version in the US for those who shop outside of the PS4's console storefront.,"**EDIT:** **I console share with my roommate/brother who has my old OG PS4 after I got my Pro version but now I switched over to the PS5. This is how I ended up in down a rabbit hole.**

After doing research with friends in the EU, US and UAE, K2 and/or Sony has (purposely?) blocked US players the ability to purchase the PS4's Standard Edition IF you're not actively searching/buying on the PS4 console's actual environment/storefront. Buying the Standard PS4 edition while on the PS5 is not possible UNLESS you get the DELUXE. 

Before the launch, you could have per-ordered the PS4 Standard port while on your PS5 and you could also leave it in your cart. After launch, the game was removed  from my cart.

Pretty much you have to be on your PS4 to be able to purchase the PS4 Standard Edition port. Outside of this, if you try to buy it via the PS5 console's storefront, the web, mobile or the mobile app, you cannot find it OR you get rerouted to a black screen with "" Not available for purchase"" if you follow links from the game's official site.

Example here: [https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI](https://imgur.com/bLxb0vI)

In the EU, you're able to buy the port while on the PSN storefront from the web/app (and I am guessing the PS5 too?) with out issues:[https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv](https://imgur.com/a/lOXoFOv) 

Xbox does not seem to have the same ""issues"" at all, here: [https://imgur.com/gVud3Px](https://imgur.com/gVud3Px)

When you're on PSN's page and you're searching for The Quarry on a browser, the tab renames itself to 'Access Denied' when the search results pop up regardless if you're logged in or not. [https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU](https://imgur.com/OtiWpgU) 

While cruising through these 6 pages, all that does come up are the DLC, the PS5 port and the Deluxe PS4/PS5 port bundle only.

From what I was told on our Discord, the UAE is having the exact same issues. Keep in mind that I cannot 100% back up this claim as I have not been able to properly investigate it. 

Does ANYONE know why this would happen, if it's intentional or not. I am guessing IF it is by design, it has to be on Sony's end as Xbox does not have the same thing going on.",,1655056686

Tlou2 does not do that. The remake is built on the same engine as 2, so that should mean that the 2 probably could get a patch soon-ish with ps5-short load times and haptic feedback. Today, 2 is ps5 only in the sense that it has framerate unlocked as it is running in ps4 pro-mode (I assume).

And since the remake is on its way to pc, I guess that work also enables 2 to hit pc at a time that is more set by marketing and business decisions rather than technical limitations.",,1655028450

PS5,vaf4sj,Recommended Games for 1st Time PlayStation Owner?,"Hey everyone! I'm a first time PlayStation owner. I'm looking for game recommendations.

A bit about me. I've always been a Nintendo player. I go for games that are cutesy (Kirby, Pokemon), challenging (Metroid Dread, Hades), and have a unique art style or are just praised and stand out in a way (Inside, Short Hike, Journey, Shadow of the Colossus). I don't usually go for games that have this realistic, gray atmosphere to them and things like Destiny, Call of Duty, or sports games really interest me.

The games I have now are Elden Ring, the 2 Spiderman games, and No Man's Sky. I bought the PS5 for Elden Ring. I'm really into the game's open world and world building. It's one of those cases where the game is just so good I don't mind the more grim, realistic art style. I will say I do take breaks from it cus of how intense it is. I love Spiderman for the traversal. I'm interested in No Man's Sky exploration. I was overwhelmed by it at first though because it was my first game on the PS5 while trying figure out the interface I was also trying to figure out the PS5 controller.

I'm interested in the Talos Principle but I can just borrow it from a friend. Gonna get Shadow of the Colossus at some point. I would get The Last of Us but I never thought I'd ever get a PlayStation so spoiled it for myself by reading it online. I also really enjoyed Astro's Playroom.

If you have any recommendations for me, let me know! I'm excited to join this community!",,1655011743

The really irritating thing is that as the second failure was out of warranty period, I have to pay for a new controller but there is only three months warranty from the PS repair clinic.

I love applying critical theories to media and thoughtful analyses of problematic BS in games and movies and all media, and I do find a lot of things problematic in the media I consume (inappropriate accents and racial stereotypes in games KILL ME for example) but if you don't play a game and think it's problematic immediately upon hearing it's basic premise or plot, you're a pretentious faux-intellectual asshat is all you are.

In this particular situation this person who watches dating reality shows (UMM PROBLEMATIC FOR PROMOTING AN EXCLUSIVELY MONOGAMOUS POV?) and all sorts of shit that I would never bother with accused me of buying into pro war propaganda by playing Fallout games without ever playing any of them for even a second, and I'm just like wow no wonder everyone sees you as a downer and no one likes you.

What the fuck kinda way is that to respond to someone talking about a game or book or movie ""oh sooo problematic"" when your own diet of media consists of trash like Love Island.

Fuck the haters, and enjoy your games, I just wanted to vent, maybe others can relate?

PS5,v9at1t,FedEx drivers trying to steal ps5?,"I am one of the lucky few who was able to get a PlayStation 5 disc edition from the Walmart restock on June 2nd



Yesterday I stayed home from work the entire day waiting for fedex to deliver my PlayStation 5. I was home watching tV and I got a notification that my package was not delivered because I wasn‚Äôt home. I called FedEx immediately because I was home and I have a doorbell camera so I know for certain there was no delivery attempt made.

FedEx apologized and said they would try again tomorrow.

I waited on my front porch for the whole morning the next day. I was determined to get my package. I saw the driver pull up and turn off his truck. He clearly didn‚Äôt see me because he didn‚Äôt look, and then started his truck to drive off. I quickly ran to the truck and called him out asking for my package. After about 10 mins of him saying my package was on a different truck I insisted he checked and he ‚Äúfound‚Äù my package in his truck.

The insistence that he didn‚Äôt have my package in my opinion was most likely him hoping I wouldn‚Äôt challenge him so he could make away with my ps5. Walmart stupidly labeled the outside of the box with a ps5 logo so of course he knew what was in the box. 

I can‚Äôt think of any other reason that he would park outside my house and not deliver a package than to steal it and make it look like delivery was attempted.

Appreciate a flat design might impede airflow as there would be no direct under channel of air the rear and any design would need sufficient venting to compensate for this making them a little uglier than they would be anyway. But for those that have the console horizontal flat plates would be crazy useful. If they were black the console would be pretty much camouflaged anyway.

That's not my question though.

So the brief history is that the original Bladestorm: Hundred Years War was release in 2007. Then in 2015 the Nightmare version (a remake with a new mode, but also graphic/gameplay enhancements I think) was released on ps4, xbox, pc.  

If you look up reviews of Nightmare you'll see shiny updated graphics and the new Fantasy mode. 

When you play/stream the PS Now version of Bladestorm: Nightmare; I'm like 99% sure it's the dated 2007 Hundred Years War version. This is both odd and frustrating, because the title card clearly states ""Nightmare"". 

Okay if that wasn't odd enough, apparently this PS Now version, purportedly released in 2015, \*\*does\*\* have the new fantasy mode.

After doing one of the best things in life (getting a 77 inch LG OLED C1) , i managed to get my hands also on a ps5. So currently i am trying to find the best settings for the HDR and i came to these recommendations :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve\_been\_doing\_ps5\_adjust\_hdr\_wrong\_heres\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/k40f5g/youve_been_doing_ps5_adjust_hdr_wrong_heres_how/)

and on this

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the\_definitive\_guide\_to\_setting\_up\_your\_tv\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/lk4buu/the_definitive_guide_to_setting_up_your_tv_for/)

Based on Vincents guide and with having in mind that your TV supports HGIG.

I know also many people swear by HGIG over Dynamic Tone Mapping HDR but the truth is that some games like Assasins Creeds Origins still look more colorful and vibrant on the Dynamic Tone Mapping (at least when i tested in on my old ps4 pro) HDR instead of the HGIG option.

So setting up my HDR on my ps5 based on these recommendations above would make HGIG also brighter and more colorful on games like Assasins Creeds Origins or i should changing to DTM for such games?

If so the ps5 hdr setting should be remain the same or adjust them accordingly?

Btw i had the impression also that the ps4 pro HDR was a bit more Vibrant than the PS5...though it might my idea but i'd like to hear your opinions on too that!",,1654865158

I‚Äôm not a fan of Battle Royale but I really liked TLOU Multiplayer and it was basically mini Battle Royale. With Naughty Dog polish they could have a mega hit multiplayer if they would have a Battle Royale mode with infected scattered around the map. 

I‚Äôm picturing Teams showing up all over the map in trucks to enter the map and start to scavenge for supplies like single player and factions. What would set this apart however is infected of all kinds scattered around and you would have to be quiet and not alert them. Or maybe set traps for other Teams. With the games setting the options are endless. I think it would be amazing honestly. The basics are already in TLOU 1 they just expand the map and add more players and infected. 

And not saying this would be only mode of course have factions also. 

Only thing is the map shrinking mechanic not sure what it could be",,1654847138

And it's the bad type of turning off, where it's not going into rest mode, but it's turning all the way off and when I turn it on again it goes through the database or whatever scan and then says my PS5 was improperly turned off.

PS5,v8wt7a,4K60 vs 4K30 HDR differences?,"Just got a PS5 and so far loving it. Just started playing GoW for the first time and it's beautiful. My TV is only HDMI 2.0 (Samsung NU8000). The video settings say I can play 4K 60fps at 4:4:2 or 4:4:0.

I want to be able to take advantage of HDR to it's fullest so if I play GoW (or any game for that matter) @ 4K 60fps, does that mean I won't be in HDR mode? My TV does say it's in HDR mode though.

Question I have is, am I still in 10bit HDR if I do game at 4K 60fps 4:4:2/4:4:0? Or does it go down to 8bit? If so, is 8bit still considered HDR? Or am I way off in my understanding?

Lastly, does playing in 4K 30fps allow it to be 4:4:4 10bit? My assumption is yes. So the last question I have is there a perceptible difference in color and HDR quality for 4:4:4 vs 4:4:2/4:4:0? In other words, does playing in 30fps vs 60fps warrant the color degradation?",,1654826449

As the title suggests, the idea here is to get to know what gear does your workstation have, how and when do you use it. Provided there is enough survey entries (at least 100) I will make a hopefully cool infographic in which you will see what fellow r/buildapc users have in their setup. How many of us use monitor light? How many of us use VESA mount/ arm? What is on your desk? Individually they are small questions but could create a cool r/dataisbeautiful style infographic :)

I made a 5 min, anonymous, survey. Feel free to skip any question you don't want to tackle, there are no mandatory questions. Even one vote helps:)

PS5,v8s0aw,"PSA: if you live in an area where electric outages are common, PS5 requires sine wave UPS, not a simulated sine wave one...","There's not enough coverage on this since it's not common for people to have blackouts, but i live in an area that have multiple power outages daily.

I bought my ps5 recently, I've had a UPS that i used for my ps4 pro, it worked fine so i just hooked my ps5 to it. It worked fine for the most part. I didn't have a problem playing ps4 games on ps5, the ps5 didn't shut down on power outages or anything, it was great. But everything went bad when i started playing native ps5 games. Anytime i had a ps5 game open (the two examples I tested were next gen cyberpunk and the matrix experience) the console would always crash during electric outages 100% of the time. The problem seems to be the fact that the transfer time from regular power to battery is too long for ps5 to handle specifically when playing next gen titles.


I tested multiple different UPS with different capacities, any of them that had simulated sine wave signal didn't work. The only thing one that worked was a UPS that uses real sine wave signal without any transfer time to battery. This was further confirmed by my friend who lives in the same area and has a ps5 with a simulated sine wave signal as well.

Tl;dr for anyone dealing with this as well since there isn't enough coverage, a simulated sign wave UPS isn't good enough, you will need a sine wave UPS to use your console.",,1654811752

I've got a decent number of games now, and the only one that will run 120fps is Spiderman, and it was an update that just came out a few weeks ago. 

Aside from this no games run at 120, everything is 60fps with low resolution mode. Kind of disappointing, don't y'all think? 

My games: 
Jedi Fallen Order
Resident Evil: Village
Spiderman (+miles morales)
Rocket League
NHL 22
Assassin's Creed Valhalla
(And a few horror games)

PS5,v8ft96,The gaming industry has changed,"The gaming industry has come a long way in my lifetime. Going from 2D to 3D. Offline play to online. Now virtual reality. As much as these achievements are great. Much sinister things lurk.

At least most of them are. The GTA trilogy. Every fifa. COD. Battlefield. It seems that getting a game out on deadline day is priority. No matter it‚Äôs condition. And some get even more broken as the year goes on. Money is the driving factor. Get it out. Make profit. Then try fixing it. Games are bait now days. Getting the best achievements came from grind and hard work. But now they dangle the best achievements in front of you for the small price of half a pint (¬£2.50). This is their market. And everyone is falling for it. It defeats the object of actually playing the game. Take GT sport for example. Yes you‚Äôd have to put some hours in to get the best cars. But it was doable. GT7 has now made that almost impossible. You‚Äôd have to put in 40 hours just to get one car. But you can have that car now if you pay a small price. The gaming world in my opinion is in its worst place. Games that used to compete against each other to out sell one another. Now it‚Äôs just make a few things up. Get a fancy promo video done for it. And what doesn‚Äôt work. We‚Äôll try and fix later. The passion has gone. Corporation ruining the experience as it taps up little kids to spend all their birthday money on the best stuff. After already paying ¬£70 for the game.",,1654777928

PS5,v8ex2o,what is the ideal release schedule for big games? would you rather have a new game every few months or a strong summer/holiday season with several games at once?,"summer and holidays used to be the best time of the year and i prefer the second option: an avalanche of great games to tempt me to spend a lot of money at once

i remember christmas time in 2001 or 2004 where a lot of incredible games released at the same time

when PS2 got GTAIII, FFX, MGS2 and DMC all ""at the same time"" and when GC and XBOX were just releasing made a huge competitive difference and set the pace of the generation

same with GTASA, HL2, DQVIII, MGS3, GT4 etc.

that kind of scenario set my mind as regards when to expect the best games - now it feels weird if an important game gets released in for example february which used to be a very weak month

and recently maybe christmas isnt just that big of a deal?

would i have cared more about HFW if it had released in december?

i hope GOWR is announced for november - it would be great to have something to look forward to this year",,1654774843

If I'm directly in front of someone, they sound fine.  But if I look away even a few degrees they get this really heavy echoing reverb effect.  I looked at all my reciever connections, ps5 settings, and in game settings and I'm pretty damn sure it isn't me.  Plus, the fact that it's only when I turn away from the source of the audio is when it kicks in makes me think is purposeful.  Some weird attempt at surround sound maybe?  But it sounds so awful there's no way right?  It kinda sounds like how in a souls game if you start to walk away from someone talking you get an echoey effect because youre hearing them in your head (or at least that's the effect I always figured they were going for).  But it makes zero sense in this setting, and when there are 10 npcs all standing and chatting in different parts of the room is disorienting as all hell.  And again, sounds just awful.  Is this how it's supposed to sound?  Or do I need to play with my settings/connections more?  If so, any reccomendations?

I have my PS5‚Äôs SIMPLINK setup in settings and the same for SIMPLINK on my LG C1. My PS5 is also always in Rest Mode and I‚Äôve never had issues with it before until recently. However, when I try to turn on my PS5 (from Rest Mode) with my DualSense by either tapping or holding the PS home button on the controller, the PS5 turns on simultaneously with the TV but once the display for the TV turns on, the PS5 automatically cycles back into Rest Mode‚Ä¶from Rest Mode.

I‚Äôve shut down and unplugged the PS5 entirely and turned on/off SIMPLINK multiple times on both devices, and both devices are updated to their latest system software. The only thing I haven‚Äôt done is reset my PS5 because I don‚Äôt want to unnecessarily risk losing game save data if I don‚Äôt have to.

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing something wrong or differently than I always have (I‚Äôm not), or if this is a software issue that can be fixed in a future update, but I‚Äôve never had issues with Rest Mode on my PS5 in the past year that I‚Äôve had it.

What would be better for me to use HDR enabled with YUV422 standard or full RGB for my games? 

With full RGB I get some ugly red/blue lights pop up (expected but still) which doesn‚Äôt look that good although colors are more vibrant, I would even say acid-y. With HRD enabled the light contrast is much more pleasant and colors are a bit smoother/dimmer which look more pleasant to my eye but real blacks or whites are not as sharp overall.

I mostly play oldish games although I do have some ps5 compatible titles like borderlands 3 and cyberpunk.

Which option would give me the best quality overall?

P.S.: if I set HDR to auto my ps5 switches it off as default and only enables it in some games.",,1654683646

PS5,v6ztnq,My first impression on Allstar-Brawl (PS5),"I played about 10 matches as kora (1v1) online and don't really want to keep on going even though i won every match. 

The gameplay is ok for type of game but very floaty. The roaster is ok as well as the graphics. But there is nothing really positiv to say. 

I am somehow missing the charm those characters and stages should have.

If you don't care for the character i'd rather recommend brawlhalla or wait for multiversus.

Have fun if you like it.

But yeah. Hopefully multiverse will be good.",,1654617903

I have a question regarding my set-up and 5.1 sound. I have the following: 

LG 50UP75006LF tv

Logitech Z906, connected via optical to the TV

PS5, connected to HDMI switch that supports 4K HDR 60HZ and supports DTS-HD, Dolby TrueHD, LPCM7.1, PCM, DTS, Dolby Digital AC3, DSD etc -&gt; TV 

What would be the best settings on my TV and PS5 to achieve 5.1? 

On TV: PCM, passthrough or automatic? 

On PS5: Which output mode? And should I choose Dolby, DTS or PCM?

Thanks for the help!

This does not happen when I use the DS4, Xbox One or Nintendo Switch Pro controllers.

At the very least I wish Sony would let use use the DS4 controller for PS5 games.  We have the option to turn off haptics anyway, so I'm not sure why they're not allowing it other than forcing people to buy more DualSense controllers.",,1654540020

People complain that the story is boring, the villains are awful, it's not as mysterious as the first game, Aloy is annoying, or fat, or both.

Of course there are a lot of people that enjoy the game as well, but it's surprisingly contraversial considering how well recieved and beloved Horizon Zero Dawn was.

I own a PS4 and expect a PS5 to arrive today. I'll sell the PS4, but will keep it around for a while so I can play It Takes Two with my wife (she's not a gamer so we never bought a second controller, this little interval will be our only chance with two controllers).

So, I read online that PS4 controllers can only be used on PS4 games. When I download the game on the new PS5, how do I make sure I'm getting the PS4 version? Should I download it first on the PS4 and tranfer it to the PS5, or can I select it straight from the new console?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the broken english, non-native speaker here.

Literally on the same day that Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest is happening. We know that the update atleast for RE3 has already been found uploaded to the PSN backend, but people are unable to download it as you can see from the link below.

So the update is already up and ready, and the sale ends on Thursday when SGF kicks off. Seems to me like if you are interested in this for the current-gen update, then you have until Thursday to get it for cheap before it launches.

PS5,v5jr4v,what do you guys think about the PSVR 2?," 

The first VR headset I ever owned was the PSVR, so PSVR was what introduced me to VR. I remember opening the box on Christmas 5 years ago, getting incredibly excited to try 6DoF VR for the first time. Then about 4-6 months later I got bored of VR, due to its shitty tracking solution and shitty controllers. So in 2019 I buy my first ever high-end PC, after saving up for a couple of months, and along with that, I decided to give VR another try, but on a new platform, pcvr. So I bought the Rift S because I didn't have the room size or money for an index, and I had that for about 4 more months before I got tired of it. And now, I'm using a Quest 2, which I love. And after 4 months, I'm still not tired of it. But now, seeing what the PSVR2 will be capable of, I'm getting that. Even if I end up not using my Quest 2. I can just sell that.

What excites me about it are the controllers. they look so much better than the touch controllers. The touch controllers are small and get in the way all the time when loading guns. But what excites me the most about them are the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. If it wasn't for those features, then I wouldn't have decided that I want it, months before it is even released.

Just one thing I'm worried about is the USB-C. Having to run a 4k120 signal through that is going to be tough. I didn't even know that was possible. And I do think the headset looks a bit... ugly. But I'm going to wear it anyways.

So I'm wondering what you guys think? are you going to get it? Or do you not care about it?",,1654454734

Here are the two different ones that I'm considering:

\[Seagate FireCuba 530\]([https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr\_1\_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-FireCuda-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B0977K3N1M/ref=sr_1_2?crid=WGER2NWVJAJY&amp;keywords=fire%2Bcuba%2B530&amp;qid=1654443653&amp;sprefix=firecuba%2B%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1))

\[SABRENT Rocket 4 Plus\]([https://www.amazon.com/1TB-SSD-Heatsink-PS5-SB-RKT4P-PSHS-1TB/dp/B09G2P4PYP/ref=sr\_1\_4?crid=ELZ1DEZ3GTVD&amp;keywords=sabrent%2Brocket%2B4%2Bplus&amp;qid=1654443626&amp;sprefix=sabren%2Caps%2C127&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/1TB-SSD-Heatsink-PS5-SB-RKT4P-PSHS-1TB/dp/B09G2P4PYP/ref=sr_1_4?crid=ELZ1DEZ3GTVD&amp;keywords=sabrent%2Brocket%2B4%2Bplus&amp;qid=1654443626&amp;sprefix=sabren%2Caps%2C127&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1))

As you can see both are the lowest prices they have been so far according to camelcamelcamel and both come with heatsinks, one is built in and the other replace the PS5's ssd cover. I don't mind these prices because they are higher tier ssds and great for long term use. I would go with the FireCuba 530 but I don't know if there is a real advantage to replacing the ssd cover with the sabrent heatsink or is the built in heatsink more than enough, or should I mix and match and get the 530 without the heatsink and get the sabrent heatsink for it instead?

It lets me report the issue, then goes through the normal sequence as though nothing had happened...until it crashes again. I haven't dared play any games on it since this started, so thus far, it's done it while watching YouTube or Netflix, or just on the Home screen.

I have power cycled it, checked to make sure my system is up-to-date, switched it from a power strip to its own socket (though with the power strip still plugged in below, in case that could be the issue)...the only thing left to do that I've seen so far is to backup my save files to a flash drive, restart the console in Safe Mode, and ""Reconfigure Console Storage.""

Has anyone else had this issue? If so, was it ever resolved? And if so, how?

Note: I bought this console from a friend about 2.5 months ago, and although he bought it in September of 2020 (so it's very much out of warranty), he says he only played about 15 hours on it (compared to my 100 or so hours).

Before quitting I've tried a USB-C to USB-C, from another device, in the front port, and workd fine.
Moved all the games, to the drive, played games, and everything was normal. 

End up buying new USB 3 to USB-C cables, and as soon I connect them on the back USB ports, my WiFi just drop straight away.

When I saw the games UI does not act as I expected, I checked the controller with different testing tools most notably Steam's and [Gamepad Tester](https://gamepad-tester.com/) website. There I saw very small jitters from both sticks; While those jitters does not have real effect on the general gameplay still I did not expect them; I have tested a couple of other non-PS controllers and they have absolutely no jitters.

For that reason, I have the controller replaced by the retailer. To my surprise the second controller had the same kind of jitters. I've read that DualSense controllers are prone to drifts after sometime but I did not expect them from a brand new one.

Now my question is: Are all DualSense controllers have the same jitters from the beginning or I've just been unlucky with my purchases?",,1654272968

Without going too much into detail the pacing was horrible in the game and the charchters were way more bland compared to the first game. The first game had all these great memorable characters like Bill, Tess, and the two brothers. While Tlou 2 had side characters like Dina, Mel, Jesse, Manny who were rather bland. As for Abby I understand her motives, but still didn't like her as a charachter. The sections with here and Lev were pretty good but felt like a worse version of Joel and Ellie.

I feel like it might either get stolen/lost or damaged since they throw luggages around with little love and pile them up might crush the console. Any tips on what I should do? If the risk is too high, I would rather just give up on tax refund and bring the unpacked ps5 onboard the plane with my hand luggage. Thanks in advance!",,1654171283

PS5,v362wn,"If there was one feature i wish the system had, it would be a System-wide Deadzone setting.","I got my PS5 7 months ago with an extra controller, and both of them started to drift after 7 months of use on their left analog stick (its slight but it can get pretty annoying), Some games like Fortnite and COD work just fine because i can set the Dead-zone, other games that i'm currently invested in such as  Metal Gear Solid V don't have a dead-zone, so stealth gets pretty hard since you just randomly start to move, its weird how some games support it, but others don't, i feel like this is a big issue since these controllers are getting pretty notorious for drifting, and once they start drifting, well... you better hope that the game you are playing has a dead-zone setting, cuz otherwise it would start getting pretty annoying, or borderline unplayable at certain points.  


Which is why every PS5 game should have a Dead-zone setting, or better yet, a system-wide Deadzone setting, so devs don't need to bake it into the game, it would give the controllers a longer life-span and  a better reputation, instead having to go buy one for 70$ nearly every 6 months of use.",,1654166964

PS5,v33fub,PS5 + Logitech Z906 solution?,"I have a PS5 and a 5.1 DTS Z906 sound system. No hdmi on it, only coax or optical...

But my TV has a hdmi arc port...

Currentlt my PS5 is plugged to the tv and the TV is plugged to the Z906 through optical. With the PS5 sound settings set to Dolby I have true directional 5.1 in games, and DTS working great on blurays, so that is the good news. It also doesn't sound compressed. That being said I am not 100% sure there is no audio channel loss with this setting.

My question is this:

I found a hdmi arc to coaxial converter on amazon. Basically I plan to leave the image transfer untouched via hdmi between the console and the tv, but extract the sound through the arc port of the TV, into the converter, then plugged to the sound system via optical or coaxial...

Does that sound like something that makes sense and would work? The goal is to have pure passthrough sound like the PS4 has when it was plugged directly through optical. Damn Sony why did you remove the optical on the PS5......",,1654155484

PS5,v2wmsl,Sony-made PS2 emulator - Would you pay for it? How much?,"I was discussing an idea with a group of coworkers the other day and wanted to see what the consensus might be for something specific. In the group of over a dozen people, every single person said they'd be willing to pay for this. And the ones that said they don't own a PS5 yet said they would be willing to buy a PS5 console just to then buy this ""digital console"" on top of it. 

The idea was as follows:

Say that Sony takes their hardware and software source to build a proper PS2 emulator. They achieve 100% game library compatibility and add features like higher resolution rendering, high frame rate support, etc for games.

Obviously this is a big undertaking, so what if Sony said ""Hey, here's a perfect (for the sake of argument) PS2 emulator. We're calling it a 'Digital Playstation 2' and it costs 300 dollars to buy. With that, you can play any PS2 discs you still own via disc. Game developers will support this platform by re-releasing PS2 games for you to buy digitally to play on our new Digital Playstation 2 for discs you don't own or want the convenience of cloud ownership"".

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine any sort of downside to this. With source access, writing the emulators isn't nearly as complex as the guesswork is with open source emulation projects. Plus, it's a huge revenue stream. It shouldn't take that many sales to pay for the labor costs associated with this type of project. With the way things stand today, Sony is just losing a lot of potential income due to PC emulation piracy. Many of those users do it only out of convenience and would be willing to pay to support the devs of the old games they loved in the past.

Not only that, but this would get around any licensing issues with old game re-releases like Microsoft bumped up against with the Series X backcompat project. This project can also be carried forward into future generations; what I mean is maybe on the PS6 or PS7 you pay an ""upgrade fee"" to bring your digital PS2 over to the new console, maybe with even more features at that time. Obviously, this idea could be extrapolated out to all of the old consoles from all manufacturers too.",,1654131363

PS5,v2tbf7,"Until folders arrive, I wish we could just remove games from home.","It's unfortunate that folders aren't a thing yet, but that's ok I'm quite patient. What bothers me though is that I can't modify the home screen betong keeping what should stay on home. On my Samsung phone I can set it to where new apps go straight to the app drawer and do not appear on my home screen unless I place them there. Implementation of that feature would be very welcome. Every time I download something new it pushes all game tiles off the screen and sometime I forget what was on my home screen.

I'm kind of hoarder with games. I have more titles than I care to admit, although a ton are ps+ titles. Being able to sort my PS4 Pro by genre and also being able to sort each folder in a specific order of my choosing was instrumental in organizing my backlog. I would sort my games by order of interest and the ones I were currently playing would be at the front and as I completed each game I would move them to the back of the list in that folder. If I wanted to do this today, I would need to make the lists by hand and organize those lists on a separate device (laptop/pen and paper). 

When I was young I had a huge interest in gaming. The problem was that my parents weren't well off. When I did get games it was always the previous generation and I only had 3 games max that I would play obsessively. I missed out on the PS3 generation completely and came in at the tail end of the PS4 generation. My first up to date console in my life was a PS4 Pro and my very first game was Horizon Zero Dawn. I had no idea what I was walking in to. Having not played any games for like 8 years, I fell in love. 

Ever since then I wanted to catch up on lost time and hit up all the PS3 remasters and PS4 reboots and sequels. I won't say how many games I have because I'm kind of embarrassed but in the past 3 years I've beaten nearly 70 games. Idk if that's a good thing or a bad thing but either way I've been deeply satisfied, and sometimes frustrated lol during this journey. FOLDERS and being able to organize my backlog was a huge, huge help in me enjoying the numerous games I've played, and I have to say it is sorely missed. 

I'm not sure if anyone else is in the same boat but I would really, really appreciate folders being added to an update soon! I know it isn't a simple task but it would make me super happy. If they could at least let us organize the home screen more that would also be great.

Thanks for the countless hours of entertainment, here's to countless more.",,1654122355

PS5,v2litn,It took me so long to find this simple solution to my loud ass disc drive...,"And the answer is a fucking towel!

When i got my ps5 i used it vertically and some games we're obviously way too loud when reading, then one day it got way worse and i changed it to horizontally. It still made a lot of noise but not as before. I also put my ps5 on a wooden cabinet. After some research i learned that its possible that my cabinet isnt stable with the loud noise as a result. For me i became convinced that my ps5 disc drive was maybe broken, so i took it to the store where i bought it. The guy told me to take off the plates and put a cd in it and see if it still makes the same loud noises. I'm glad he told me this cause the noise was reduced and i didn't believe my disc drive was broken no more. I do believe that diffrent games are being read by a diffrent speed cause bloodborne spins the slowest of em all. That game never makes noise when reading. Elden ring comes in second and Dark Souls 3 just makes my ps5 sound like broken jet engine trying to fly away. so I took a towel and placed it under my horizontal ps5 and the disc drive noise was reduced but still not quite as it should sound... I kept it like this for a few weeks until i figured why not fold the towel one more time and it try it like that. Voila, this is all that was needed. Obviously the ps5 disc drive makes some noise when reading, but this was it. This is exactly what its supposed to sound like, and im not sure how to explain it. I think the problem lies with the ps5 plates. People have diffrent places where they put their ps5 but the plates just vibrate and give off this broken sound on a lot of diffrent platforms i believe. Also everyone has their own solution to this, cause the guy who i talked too had the same issue and he resolved it by placing a piece of clay up on his ps5 when its vertically standing, lol. So im wondering if some of you out there had this issue and if so how did you fix it?",,1654102387

PS5,v2k1l0,"If you played through God of War 2018 every time it came out, you will have played through it 6 times in 4 years.","God of war is a great game for sure, but it has entered and exited so many PlayStation services by now that getting it for free has essentially surpassed Skyrim‚Äôs re-releases. If you played the game each time it came out on a service, you would have beaten it 6 times as of this summer:

Release in April 2018
Added to PSNow the first time (later removed)
Added to PS Plus Collection
Added to PSNow again
Being added to the new PS Plus Extra tiers

PS5,v2jvuv,Wait for higher capacity model?,"I am a PlayStation fan but I have not been really fussed about getting a PS5 as I still quite a few PS4 games to play and one big barrier for me was that my TV was a 9 year old 1080p TV and I wanted to experience PS5 on a 4K TV from the beginning.

So, I finally have 4K TV now and now I am debating whether to wait a few more months to see if Sony announce maybe any resign like PS5 slim or maybe a black version (I know they have official covers now) or maybe even a higher capacity model which comes maybe around 2TB native storage.

The chances of a slim version coming out this year highly unlikely and no doubt be snipped by scalpers again and black version is cosmetic (even though I not really a fan of the default white) so a possible higher capacity model by end of year is a possibility and this is what keeping me from actively hunting for PS5 now.

Yes, stocks were still short I had a chance to order in stock disk version last week and didn't do it.

So, what are your guy‚Äôs thoughts on a possibility of higher capacity model being released this year and whether it would be better to wait or get a PS5 asap if you can get one in stock at retail price?",,1654098104

PS5,v1vvoc,"Masterpieces ala Half Life, Portal, Silent Hill, System Shock, Legend of Legaia and many many more need constant updates.","Games are no music or movies. Thanks to gameplay and the fact that they are still young in comparison, the jumps from generation to generations are still high (with slowing down in the future of course‚Ä¶at least when it comes to realism (graphics)). 

Many people not only won‚Äôt but can‚Äôt play 20y old games. Hell even someone who‚Äôs first console was an Atari struggles to replay those Atari classics. 

A new generation of gamer is not the same as a new generation in life. It‚Äôs not 30years long. For millions even PS3 titles are already unplayable. They are not conditioned for them. 

The market is good with remasters but that‚Äôs not enough. 100s of games need updates. On multiple platforms. That I can‚Äôt play Half Life or Legend of Legaia on my Ps5 is ridiculous. Do we really need a Resident evil 4 remake instead of a Dino crisis remake? Count how many times RE4 got a remaster and how many times DC. And how many zombie games exists and how many Dino horror titles. RE4 is already fine. Til ps6. 

Sony also needs to refresh their ‚Äúfor all generations‚Äù titles. Thanks to mostly mature games, they are loosing million casual gamers to Nintendo. Instead of making times exclusive deals, use that money for making games ala Sly, Jak and Dexter etc. great again. I don‚Äôt care if Xbox gets the game to play or not. For me the lineup is the same.

PS5,v1bplr,"Mouse &amp; Keyboard, how popular is it ?","Hello guys. This is mine first writing on PS5 subreddit. Im proud  PS5 owner seance Christmas. First of all, I'm not complaining. Im not  accusing anybody. Im just wondering, in your guys opinion, how popular M&amp;K setup on PS5 is these days. How many people are using in multiplayer games. 1%, 10%, more ?

I got PS5 last year running from PC cheaters but then again, I run in to another problem. And that is M&amp;K players. In BF5, lets say, if a guy is using mouse, hes making 90-150 kills with no problem. One guy that I played against 2 rounds, hes making  2.45 kills /min.  Something like 90:4 almost every game, 20% headshot kills etc etc. And hes not using vehicles. Im not saying its not fair, Im not accusing its cheating if PS5 is supporting the mouse out of the box. But Im not shore, do I continue  to play with controller or do I jump on to M&amp;K setup?

If those people are rare, that ok, its not a big deal, but if its more and more popular, do I switch?  


Again, you have to keep in mind how hard is to play against real cheaters on PC and how mentally  devastating is. And I was thinking, console gaming here I come, but then, M&amp;K is now more popular on a console then ever.   


So I don know what to do. I mainly playing MP gamse: BF, R6, Hell Let Loose, PUBG, Sandstorm, etc.  


Thank you.",,1653950059

PS5,v119g1,"One and a half years since PS5 launched, and games still run at 60fps. Are you finally convinced that 60fps is here to stay?","Just a year ago, many people still seemed to be convinced that eventually, at *some mysterious point in the future*, developers will go back to pump their resolution and visual settings to eleven and turn performance back to **30 frames per second** instead. 

Others, at the same time, claimed the increasing trend of ""performance modes"", which prioritize framerate and allow us to play at 60fps or even 120fps, will keep increasing in the future, and the option to choose performance over visual fidelity is here to stay.

We're now 1 1/2 years from launch of the PS5 (and XBox SeX), and I still happily enjoy my PS5 games at wonderfully smooth 60fps.

The way I see it: 30fps is an outdated standard - otherwise developers today wouldn't go out of their way to make their games run at 60 to begin with - and as such, 30fps is finally getting left behind. When HD resolution (1080p) became a thing, developers didn't go back to 480p just to pump their visuals up. 1080p gaming stayed and became the baseline (minus Nintendo), and finally evolved to 1440p, even native 4k. Technology evolves. Resolution evolved. Framerate evolves. This is what we're seeing here. 

The PS5 even has a ""prioritize performance"" mode integrating into its system settings!

**I'm wondering - are people still convinced we will eventually have to go back to 30fps gaming, and if so, why? Were you convinced before but changed your mind in the meantime, and if so, what was the reason? Please feel free to discuss and enjoy.**",,1653920404

PS5,v0tao5,PS5 Informational guide. All you need to know about the PS5,"There are two versions of the PS5, the physical/disk version and the Digital version of the PS5, The physical/disk version will be up at the top of the list and the digital version will be closer to the bottom of the list.

The Physical/Disk version of the PS5

Price: 499$ USD or 394 GBP

The Physical version of the PS5 is the more expensive of the two for a good reason, it has a disk drive for the console and is slightly more powerful than the digital and is also the more popular version. The PS5 can back track to the PS4 but it can‚Äôt go any further than the PS4, but you can play PS1 and PS2 emulations on the PS5 by buying the game in the PlayStation game store. When you put in a PS4 disk into the PS5 it will show a PS4 icon for the game, and the same for a PS5 game but just with a PS5 icon. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.

The digital version of the PS5

Price: 399$ USD or 315 GBP

The digital version is the cheaper of the two because of the disk drive being non-existent on the digital version, unfortunately because of the disk drive not being there is it worse than the physical version. The PS5 can run PS1 and PS2 emulations by buying them in the PlayStation game store. The PS5 is supported for 4K but can go up to 8K. The PS5 is also really easy to clean, all you need to do is take off the plates and take a vacuum and put it up to the dedicated holes to clean it. The PS5 storage can also be upgraded by taking off the plates and plugging in the memory but the only downside is the price of the memory chip, the memory chip has to have a heat sync and it have to be powerful enough to run in the PS5.


Buying the PS5

Whether you want the digital version or the physical/disk version the buying will be the same. There are two ways, the in person way or the online way, personally the in person way is much easier, the in person way is simple to do, all you need to do is call your local game store or wherever you want to buy your PS5 and ask when the next PS5 restock is and just come a couple hours early before they open and just wait, that‚Äôs the way that I did it although I had to buy it in a bundle and i spent 900$ USD for my PS5, online is more complicated, you basically need to spam click the buy button right at restock in order to have a chance to buy it or you can register your chances at the PlayStation website.

There you are, I hope this helped you out!",,1653889396

So being able to install a plethora of games is extremely important, because not only do some days consist of sitting around doing very little; but also I have colleagues who also play on the console, who like different games.

So yes, I could delete a game and download a new one while at home, or somewhere with the ability to get online. But it‚Äôs not always an option.

PS5,v04vu8,bro how is it this unstable?,"My PS5 which i got last year on Christmas is very unstable to the point that spiderman miles morales crashes before it even finishes loading and this is the most recent and extreme case ive had and i only started using it for about a week it doesn't make sense yes i got it  on Christmas but i haven't started using it until now and now that im using it it's mind bogglingly unstable any game may it be ones from my ps4 that ran perfectly fine on it, now have a large chance of crashing for no reason im getting really upset over it now 
The one and only game that hasn't crashed or has crashed the least is dmc5 special edition and it cant be because the data is corrupted i just set the thing up unless it somehow corrupted DURING THE CONSOLE SETUP  i dont understand how it could be this bad yeah my ps4 crashed a few times but it was only for a couple games and it was specific reasons god of war 2018 was kinda buggy on my ps4 and crashed SOMETIMES same with fallout 4 but  fallout 4 was a good but very very janky mess of a game at times even before i started using mods on it 
And i think the first spider man was a little buggy and would crash too but it was nowhere near as bad as its successor 
I cant open a game without having to hold my breath in anticipation for it to crash  now cause almost no game is safe 
EVEN ASTRO'S PLAYROOM A GAME BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM ISNT SAFE  on memory meadow it crashes WITH OUT FAIL 
Most of the time immediately sometimes i can get some work done in the level but mostly just as soon as i drop into the level astro cant even reach the ground before it crashes 
Like seriously i dont know what to do anymore other than just to deal with it and i keep sending the error reports in hopes that they will see and fix the problem but IF ONLY I WERE THAT LUCKY i cant help but ramble on and on over it but just to tell you my story of warning and misfortune be happy you arent me cause my tech never wants to work with me this wasnt really me trying to get help for the problem it was just to let it be known and not be an experience just for me to suffer in",,1653803985

PS5,v01orl,Guide: Hacking discord to work with PS5,"Hi everyone, of course it's very stupid and annoying to try to play PS5 with your discord friends on PC. Here's what you need for a workaround:

1. headphone splitter cable. I'd try to get them from a local electronics store rather than something online

2. headphones that have a removable cable, that can be connected with a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable.

3. a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable. In fact, two of them.

4. a device that can run discord and has a microphone. I used my laptop.

Put it all together. Connect the jack of the headphone splitter to your headphones. From the two ports on the headphone splitter, use the two cables and connect your discord device and PS5. The headphone splitter I'm using just automatically combines the audio from both sources into the headphones. My friends can hear what I'm saying because the laptop picks it up just fine. You just have to tweak the audio on both console and device to make sure it's right.

Hope this helps someone! I was so excited when I got it to work.",,1653790965

PS5,uzqr7m,Some PSVR games already have upgrade/next-gen patch on PS5 even with old PSVR.,"This is something I don't see a lot of people commenting on, but some games already have massive improvement when played on PS5 even though it's a PS4 app, sure... it's still limited by the resolution of the original PSVR, but I think when PSVR 2 arrives it will probably be backwards compatible with the original PSVR games so it's really nice to know that some games already run better when played on the PS5 even with the original PSVR.

&amp;#x200B;

Of the two games I know are:

&amp;#x200B;

Zenith: The Last City :

When played on PS4 or PS4 Pro the game has very large loadings times on some areas, on the PS5 these loadings times do not exist, in addition the resolution is better, texture quality is slightly better and the draw-distance is much greater.

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjWQzvO0gbw)

&amp;#x200B;

No Man's Sky VR :

The PS4 version is a blurry mess, on PS5 not only the resolution is much better but also the texture quality, shadow quality, foliage and etc... is much higher.

[https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE](https://youtu.be/9m8q7Bz2IuE)

&amp;#x200B;

There are other games like Star Wars Squadrons, Hubris VR and Swordsman VR that apparently also have significant improvements when played on PS5 even with the original PSVR, but I can't confirm about this game, I wonder if more other games like Resident Evil 7 will get it. upgrade to PS5 in the future.",,1653755046

I know this is a question that is often asked esp. on this sub so my apologies but there‚Äôs been a lot of developments as of late so I feel like this time around that classic question of Xbox X vs ps5 is different. 


For the longest time, I told myself I'm getting a Xbox series X mainly because of Gamepass and how awesome it is. Even when Sony announced their new competitor. But now, I'm really torn. On the one hand, gamepass is still awesome. Especially with the Blizzard-Activision acquisition which could bring COD to gamepass which is major news for me because now I don't have to shell out 60 dollars every year. But at the same time Sonys competitor is seriously starting to look good. Just today, they announced some Ubisoft classic games (certain curated games) are coming to the Extra bundle of The new ps plus (article: Ubisoft classic). I also really am a fan of the new Sony controller. If anyone has been keeping up with all the recent news I would really appreciate some advice.

I've always been a PlayStation guy , not because I'm a fanboy or anything , its just Xbox is really unpopular where i live and back in the day there weren't many OG xbox's and 360's. So i bought the ps2 , psp , ps3 , ps4 and now ps5. Also I don't like digital games , I like physical copies and if i get a chance to buy a physical copy i usually go for it . That's also mostly because internet back in the ps2 , ps3 cycle , in my country wasn't good. So i have all these ps2 games , ps3 games that are just lying there .  
A CD if preserved can last up to 200 years , most ps3's break down after like 12-15 years of normal use.   
So all those CD's which are memories, mementoes from past which i paid for at that time are just paperweights and will be paperweights after my ps3 eventually breaks down. i was so happy when i learnt that ps5 will have ps4 disc's backwards compatibility. I mean sure the new PS Plus subscription is fine and dandy and allows you to play classic ps games but i don't want to pay 120 dollars a year to play games that i already own. On the other hand Xbox has done such a good job with backwards compatibility everything starting from the OG xbox to xbox one is backwards compatible (sure there are some games that you cant play) and you don't have to pay a subscription to pay the games if you already own its physical copy , just put it in and voila.

PS5,uzmek5,PS5 Microphone Input Issues,"So, here‚Äôs how it goes:

I‚Äôm probably bored on my phone, when I come up with the idea to hop on Call of Duty. I grab my SteelSeries 3 (specifically console edition) and I go ahead and check it‚Äôs unmuted before I plug it into the controller because I had heard that fixes the following problem I‚Äôm about to have that I‚Äôve had in the past.

The audio output settings are perfect, but it‚Äôs the microphone settings that are really messed up‚Ä¶ apparently the PS5 or whatever is supposed to recognize that I have a headset plugged in is messed up (even after plugging being unmuted). In the microphone settings, it says ‚ÄúInput Device‚Äù, and next to it says, ‚ÄúMicrophone on Controller‚Äù.

‚ÄúUh-oh!‚Äú As my bad memories flood and invade my mind reminding me that this problem will never be fixed. 

I press the little ‚ÄúInput Device‚Äù thing (while my headphones are plugged of course) and the ‚ÄúMicrophone on Controller thing is the only option.

I also know that it isn‚Äôt my headphones because when I pressed on the ‚ÄúAdjust Microphone Level‚Äù thing and I lightly tapped my headset mic and controller, and I could safely say that it was indeed my controller.

What a mischievous little controller I have‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs probably jealous of the headset, loser.

Here‚Äôs what I haven‚Äôt yet tried:

-Smashing the controller against the ground
-Returning the headset

I literally need help immediately, and yes, everything is plugged in correctly and nothing is loose. Please, help and don‚Äôt let the controller win this war‚Ä¶",,1653741228

PS5,uzlosq,ps5 wont read discs after playing gran turismo 7,"Guys of reddit help me out here,  I've had my ps5 since July last year and it's been great runs fine all the expected.
I got gran turismo 7 over a week ago and I don't play my ps5 everyday due to work and stuff so it's mainly a weekend thing. So yeah I started playing gran turismo 7 and loving it! But thought I want to go back to another game I need to finish. Dying Light 2 to be exact and Lord behold it can't read the disc, Comes up with the error unreadable disc. So I tried a few other discs like last of us part 2 and other ps4 and none would read. But as soon as I put gran turismo 7 back in it reads it fine? 
After that I booted into safe mode and did a clear system software cache and rebuild the database which worked. It read all the other games fine. I even played dying light 2 for abit. After that I thought I'd try gran turismo again and yep you guessed it..  won't read any other discs bar that one.. Great... so did what I did before rebuild the database etc. But this time it didn't work. Fab... so went back to safe mode and checked if there was an update im missing just incase i didn't get a notification for it. And there was so the ps5 updated and it reads discs again but I'm scared to put gran turismo back in incase it messes the ps5 up üòÖ

PS5,uzhuhu,My Playstation 5 is showing picture glitches in PS Plus menu!,"Hi everyone!

Hope all of you are doing fine, I am new to the community and I recently had the privilege of buying myself a brand new PS5. It is barely 10 days old, I have set it up and was enjoying it on tcl c728 QLED tv. Everything was fine until today when I started to observe very irritating glitches in the PS Plus menu. So, the thing is where the whole PS plus library is listed, this one game (Days Gone) image is all weird and by weird I mean a glitch. Every other title is fine (appearance wise, it is as it should be).

Now hovering down there is another glitch on one of the blocks of Ps Plus menu and text appears shadowy and there are pixels everywhere. Apart from that everything is fine, the games, other menu items, the setting, all is solid except the Ps Plus menu. **(For some reason I can't attach any screenshots here)**

**Following are the things that I have tried;**

**-Restarting the PS5**

**-Shutting it down and powering it back on**

**-Changing from ethernet to Wi-Fi and from Wi-Fi back to the ethernet**

Nothing seems to fix it and it is driving me crazy, it is a completely brand new device, the PS5 itself and the TV. Can't pinpoint what the issue might be. If anyone can help me I shall be very thankful. I wasn't able to find anything regarding this issue not on Google, YouTube or even Reddit. Seems like a special case.

Plz help!

P.S. It appears that for some reason Days Gone logo is being replaced with a sack boy block that is below the games. Please any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks",,1653721198

And man did it live up to its expectations. If it wasn't for demons souls remake being a PS5 exclusive I probably still wouldn't have one. When I first got my PS5 and played Astros playroom I was all smiles. So this is what next gen will feel like. I was so excited. But then none of the games besides returnal used those features. The console is still too new and I understand that. But even a game like demons souls which was a PS5 exclusive didn't use or even have a option to use those features. It's a perfect console and I can't wait to see what games feel like in a few years when they all use the haptics / adaptive triggers.,,1653714253

PS5,uzattj,Dualsense vibration becomes rattling after prolonged playing,"Basically what title says: I have a PS5 for couple of months, and recently I noticed, while playing God of War, that after like 30 minutes of playing, the vibration of the Dualsense controller becomes much louder, kinda like rattling or rumbling, as if there was something loose inside the controller.

When I shake the controller manually, I hear nothing. When I wait for couple of minutes, and continue playing, it is still there. First I thought it's intentional loud vibration from the game. But when I turn off the controller, just for a couple of seconds, and turn it on again, it goes away. The vibrations become soft purrs again. And it returns again after 15 minutes of playing or so.

Anyone experiencing anything similar? It doesn't seem like a hardware issue, as it goes away with just turning off and on again. I have to check if it happens with other games too, but I believe it does. It doesn't affect gameplay, it's just a bit unsettling. Not sure if I can even claim a warranty for this.

Even when I turn my system volume and game volume all the way up it's still a lot quieter than I would like. Anyone know a fix?

I've done my research before on what controller I should get but I haven't done it that well. I read in an article posted by someone that said the new controllers have gotten an upgrade. joysticks and triggers/buttons, I got mixed up and though the cosmic red came out with the starlight blue and the other 2 colors but after purchasing the controller I have just realised that the cosmic red is older and it might not have that significant upgrades and changes. Am I in the wrong? Have the ""older"" dualsense that are newer than the original dualsense been improved than the original white? Has Sony changed the cosmic red and black dualsense after they've started to sell the newer three colors? Should I stay with the cosmic red or get a refund and buy another one?

I still have the warranty but my little sister completely demolished the box.",,1653671014

PS5,uyedd6,Porting games to PC,"Sony recently released sales numbers on a few games they've ported to PC.

Horizon Zero Dawn:
Copies Sold- 2.39 million
Revenue- 60 million

Days Gone:
Copies Sold- 852k
Revenue- 22.7 million

God of War:
Copies sold- 971k
Revenue- 26.2 million

Based on these numbers I can definitely see why Sony waits so long to port over their games. GOW selling &gt;1 million copies, in about half a year makes me think two things. 1. PC gamers pirated that game alot. 2. PC gamers are not as enthusiastic about PS games as some believed. I know the game has only been out for about 5 months but a game that big and beloved should have sold more I feel. Especially given the fact that it's release was alot better than HZD's. 

I don't have a problem with PC releases but if this is what Sony gets then Day 1 is certainly out of the question for probably every first party release. Anyone with their hopes up for a Bloodborne PC port these numbers don't look good for that. I'd put my money on a 60 fps update.

Let me know if you agree or came to different conclusions based on the figures they released. I've seen some ""discussion"" online (Twitter) but I felt like this is the better space for that.",,1653590459

PS5,uyctny,PS5 glitch/freeze/Idk ?,"So, today I had just closed ‚ÄòTomb Raider‚Äô on My ps5, when I quickly went into one of my friends profiles. While scrolling through his games, the list stopped updating/loading. I hit ‚ÄòO‚Äô to go all the way back to the Home Screen, and when I tried to get back to my profile using the quick access bar, it would not go through.

My PS5 didn‚Äôt necessarily freeze as I could still navigate around the menu, but nothing was loading (psstore, psplus, nothing), and whenever I selected a prompt like going to settings or, even turning it off, nothing happened. Even when I hovered over the game, there were no stats of your trophies in the corner, or even a ‚ÄòPlay game‚Äô button. Also noticed that my online status had be greyed out.

I tried to log out, which it actually did, but didn‚Äôt show me the actual profiles page, just the background graphic, of the light shining through the grey.

Eventually I had to take it off by the plug, because it wasn‚Äôt letting me manually turn off (in retrospect, I just learnt that it takes 20 secs of holding down the button to hard reset, which I didn‚Äôt hold for that long, so that‚Äôs on me). All seems to be fine now.

Anyone have any idea what happened, and if I need to worry? Thanks in advance",,1653586169

PS5,uyckxz,So... about cross-gen games.,[removed],reddit,1653585478
PS5,uycd7n,So... about cross-gen games.,"Honestly I don't blame Sony for revising their strategy and making future releases like God of War: Ragnarok become cross-gen games.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people want to see ''only-next-gen'' games but what's the point if this is going to significantly affect the game's sales since a lot of people can't even find a PS5 to buy yet?

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the new Horizon is the most beautiful game I've seen on PS5 so far and it's a cross-gen game that came out for PS4 too, if the next cross-gen releases don't affect the quality of the next-gen versions then I'm more than satisfied, people need to play this game, if ps4 is the only option for them to play then great, i don't think it's bad to keep cross-gen games for another year, at least until this out of stock issue and scalpers is finally resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, what doesn't make sense is to want only-next-gen games while this problem is not solved once and for all, this is even a little selfish if you stop to think about it.",,1653584890

I moved from Aus to UK and brought my PS5 with me. I know a lot about the region difficulties with PSN etc. but I just wanted to ask for a hypothetical scenario. Let's say Horizon Forbidden West came out with DLC. I have bought a physical copy of that game in the UK not Australia (which is where my PSN is situated). If DLC were to hypothetically come out for it, would it be possible for me to buy that DLC for my UK copy of Horizon and for it to work?

I know I can't buy DLC from a different PSN storefront, but as far as I understand, for DLC to work it just needs to match the product/region code of the game, as far as I am aware the UK and Aus have the same region as they both have PPSA on the sides of their game covers and they are both in R2? So in theory the DLC should work? Thanks in advance!",,1653500071

Been playing Metal Gear Solid 4 and other PS3 titles on the pc lately and was wondering what the chances are of MGS4 coming to the new subscription service? It kind of sucks it will be via cloud gaming so i'm hoping they'll be able to emulate PS3 games on the PS5 somewhere down the line.   
I don't know why but i find most PS exclusives these days pretty stale and boring (they all feel the same with a different setting to me) and am having much more fun playing the PS3 titles. Maybe i'm just getting old xD   
Is there also any chance there will be new MGS games in the future? Whether they are remakes or completely new ones :)

I finally decided to pick the PS5 over the Xbox (which might be stupid, as you get one and can't lay hand on the other), mainly for Hogwarts Legacy (my Computer ain't working Three Kingdoms anymore, so it was that or a new computer for six times the price to play the exact same games), and I've really grown confused with all that Drops as of now.
But since I don't technically need it before Legacy comes out around September/October, I'm not really sure which guide to believe, as they all say something different. Many people seem to say that one should pick the first offer you can grab, as production will expectedly take a huge blow over the summer (or so they say), while others say to patiently wait until price drops to what its supposed to be.
I'm not really sure, so I'm gonna ask her - I don't really wanna pay an extra 200 for buying it right now, but it seems to be completely impossible to grab hold of one for the regular price now. Should I grab it immediately when there is one I can get or wait for the perfect offer?",,1653463552

PS5,ux5y5c,"Can we stop with the fake ""alpha/beta"" titles and properly call them stress tests?","It is just so obsurd to think that a developer would give alpha/beta access to console players on AAA titles.    On PC some small indie devs, sure they may do that if want to spread the word but definitely not to thousands.     Maybe a few dozen.  

Why is this done?   Because publishers think it makes players feel *special"" and I guess gives bragging rights.  (I been playing since the beta).    Idk I guess kids care about that crap.    These beta/alpha ""tests"" are actually what the gaming industry considers as ""stress tests"" .        I have seen a few times where devs will say it's a stress test before launch but majority of the time it's alpha/beta. 

When a game is development during the alpha stages most textures/animations are not even finalized and the only people who could even get a sneak peek were game journalists but were under heavy NDAs.   The real NDAs where at the very least you were kicked out of the gaming industry if not facing jail time and heavy fines to ruin your life. 

I don't know why I let it bother me so much I guess it's always been a pet peeve of mine.     When a game has already gone gold and they are still doing a ""beta"" test it just annoys me when someone finds a genuine complaint only to be met with ""Its just the beta it will be fixed at launch"".

PS5,ux3xw3,I cannot believe how much fun Multiversus is.,"About 20-25 hours in so far playing the closed Alpha and it‚Äôs so much fun. This is a full blown live service ‚ÄúSmash‚Äù experience, albeit in its own take of course.

There‚Äôs so much to do, *so much to earn*, ranked mode, battle passes, custom lobbies, every single character has their voice actors returning to voice them, etc etc etc. The fighting feels so satisfying too! 

You get like 300 coins when winning a match, and each character costs 2,000 coins to unlock so its rather fast (could very well change for launch but it should be similar). They‚Äôre going to make their money mainly with skins and to get characters faster, and *man* are they leaning into the fan service!

One of my favorite shows of all time is Adventure Time, the closed Alpha has a free battlepass that goes to level 50 and one and of the skins is an alternate version of Jake, Cake, from [Fiona and Cake](https://images.app.goo.gl/ZrUbFfztHvXE4P5i9)! And you guessed it, they brought the VA who voices Cake to voice the lines as well! This is just one example of many. They could have easily done something super simple like Jake in a number of outfits, so I was shocked they‚Äôre already doing stuff like this, the fan-service is going to be **real** haha.

The biggest indicator for me was a few of my friends who are HUGE into Smash, they still play every single week, go to tournaments, hang out at weekly Smash events, and ever since they started playing the Alpha they *have not stopped playing it*, they‚Äôre loving it! So excited for open beta when everyone can play.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but I genuinely think this will be up there with Smash.",,1653434698

PS5,ux0lmh,Best method to split HDMI 2.1 cable to 2.1 Video with toslink optical audio out to Dolby Digital DTS amp,"Finally managed to get hold of a PS5 only to discover they've ditched the onboard toslink connector! 

My TV is a Samsung QE55Q70R - not 2.1 (2.0b?) but does do stuff at 120Hz + freesync etc

From what I'm reading, people are suggesting using the optical audio out on the TV. However, I'm worried about 2 things. Firstly latency (as the trip will be longer than from the PS5 straight to the amp) and also I'm not sure if my TV can support it (just tested with my PS4 setup - this is using a hdmi 2.0 cable though - however - can't select Dolby Digital as the audio out when the PS4 is running on it).

I'm thinking the best solution would be to bring the 2.1 HDMI out for the ps5 into one of those splitter boxes, which outputs hdmi video out and also provides a toslink output, which can then go straight to my amp. However, I'm worried about whether these boxes effecting both the audio and video quality. 

Firstly, would this be an OK approach and secondly are there any recommended brands of the splitter boxes?

I've tried to get my head around ""Arc"" - but baffles me a bit - just need an optical out carrying DTS 5.1.",,1653425102

The current issue we are dealing with is that the NAT type is blocking us from playing with one another.

When we both started off unable to play cross-console, we were both NAT type 3, and aimed to fix it. But whenever we follow whatever is recommended online to fix NAT type issues, one of us goes to NAT type 2 as planned, while the other stays in 3. Then, we follow another method, and the Type 2 gets switched over to the other console, and the other has Type 3. This problem has persisted for the past two days now, and despite constant efforts to be able to play with each other, no posts online have seemed to work, which is very disheartening, since I gave my roommate a PS4 so that we had things in common for us to play.

PS5,uwqrtz,This needs to be spread out. PlayStation is making users to pay back the discount they got when upgrading membership.,"It was exciting when I found out the new PlayStation Plus service tiers have arrived, but my joy was gone within seconds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's how much Sony charges for all three tiers of membership in Hong Kong:**

**Essential: HKD 308**

**Extra: HKD 515**

**Deluxe: HKD 599**

&amp;#x200B;

I have 3 years and 19 days left.

I bought my 4 years of membership for the price of HKD 231/205/205/205, when it was discounted last year.

&amp;#x200B;

**At first, I thought I only have to pay for the differences between Essential and Deluxe, which should be:**

**(599-308) x 3=873**

**And 19 days should be:**

**(599-308) √∑ 365 x 19=15.15**

**Total should be:**

**873+15.15=HKD 888.15**

&amp;#x200B;

**But Sony decides I have to pay back the discount I got last year.**

**Here's the calculation:**

**(599-205)=394 x 3=1182**

**(599-231) √∑ 365 x 19=19.16**

**Total: 1182+19.16=1201.16**

&amp;#x200B;

**Almost identical to the price Sony is asking on the upgrade page.**

&amp;#x200B;

I understand it might cost a lot for Sony to launch the service, but seriously, taking back the discounts I've gotten already? That's low.

PS5,uwhep4,I'm so disappointed in the new PS plus,"I am a PlayStation player of Hong Kong. This morning, I excitedly opened PS5 and prepared to upgrade my PS plus to extra to download new games. But in the upgrade interface, I vaguely felt that there was an upgrade price problem. I'll explain that in more details.

1. There is only one option for you to upgrade your PS plus. Upgrade all remaining days or not upgrade. And if you purchased PS Plus with a discount before, you need to pay SONY back all the money of the previous discount when upgrading.

2. When new PS plus published, SONY announced that there would be more than 400 games in PS plus extra. In fact, there are only 247 games in the library. And if a game has ps4 and PS5 versions, it counts as two games. In summary, the actually number of games should be no more than 200. And there are some PS4 games that I think are in tier 2 libraries that actually need tier 3 to play.

I bought a one-year PS Plus membership at a discount of 205HK before. The cost of my upgrade is 222.51HK. According to my expectation, I need to pay 148HK for the upgrading:(515-308)\*261/365=148HK

But I actually need a lot more than that, so I do the math

(515-205)\*((261+1)/365)=222.52

So, upgrade cost = (original price - the price you actually paid) \* ((remaining days +1) /365)

It means that no matter how long you bought it at the discount price, SONY now requires you to pay the full price if you want to upgrade your PS plus, and you have to upgrade the remaining days all at once.

All in all, the new PS plus are not as good as I expected. and one more question, why pictures are not allowed in raddit?",,1653362022

PS5,uwdtl2,"If your original PS plus membership was purchased with a discount, Sony will include the difference in the discounted price into the upgrade fee when you upgrade to PS Extra/Deluxe membership.","I purchased PS+ last year with a 50% discount which is 154HKD/year. Here we do a simple maths problem.

The original PS Plus in HK is 308HKD/year, and the PS Deluxe in HK is 599HKD/year

The difference should be 599-308=291HKD/year.  This is equal to 0.797HKD/day. That means my upgrade fee for 88 days should be 70HKD.

However, the fact is my upgrade fee for 88 days is 107.28 HKD = 1.219 HKD/day.

599-154=445HKD/year. This is equal to 1.219HKD/day.

Definitely, SIE is one of the greediest publishers I‚Äòve ever seen.

PS5,uw7ro4,Current Disappointment,"About 2 months ago I finally bit the bullet and got the PS5 for a relatively decent price all things considered. It works great, the haptic feedback is amazing, the load times are phenomenal and I only had one crash so far. The issue is, I'm pretty much just using it as an upgraded PS4, because sadly the games so far for the 5 have just been so... terrible. 

The moment I had finished setting up I downloaded dying light 2, I had loved the first games flaws and all, got nearly 600 hours into it over the last 5 years or so, I had purposely avoided spoilers, and was excited for the sequel to pick up where the last had left off, search for a cure, and explore a larger parkour and zombie slaying paradise. 

Instead we got parkour so floaty it feels like you're full of helium, combat so utterly tedious you end up trying to run past enemies just so you don't have to deal with them, a story so depressing, cliche and bland it feels like it was written at the last minute, two factions who barely matter, barely any weapons compared to the last game, and an RPG outfit and skill system that feels completely unfinished and useless. 

So after forcing myself through that hot mess just to see the ending and complete it, I moved on to another sequel I was excited about, Horizon: Forbidden west. Yes the game actually came out, though everyone was to busy playing elden ring to notice. 

So, HFW... at first it was great, the open world was huge and diverse, the story and dialogue were interesting, but then.. the combat, so utterly unbalanced you end up changing over to story difficulty just so you don't die to the mandatory boss in the storyline 40 times. The black box quest is bugged to hell, many weapons feel like you're trying to kill a Trex with a nail gun, concentration is supposed to  slow down the game as you aim so you can nail those vulnerable spots right? Well good luck as it seems the arrows go wherever the hell they want sometimes, and when you go into slowmo, the models start to freak out and spaz around like a crate stuck in a wall in Garry's mod. Then the story just slowly gets less and less intriguing, the characters lose motivation, the combat just gets harder and harder, oh and if you think maybe you just need the best gear, go to the arena and get it, yeah I dare you, it's one of the most unbalanced, tedious, and brutal things I've ever seen, and you have to PAY EACH TIME YOU TRY IT. 

now I'm just back to playing my old favorites with thankfully much faster load times and some improved hdr and fr. and the only PS5 game I actually play is vanguard, which is hit or miss depending on the internet of the other players and how many tryhards their are in a given match, and also the weapons are so unbalanced theirs like 3 that are actually worth even using so, it can get boring pretty fast. 

I'm sure I'm gonna get hit with alot of 'git gud' which I guess is to be expected, I'm sure elden ring is amazing, but I don't wanna pay 60 dollars to get destroyed 50 times in a row, to some that's wonderful I get it, it's a challenge to overcome, but to me that just sounds so depressing and exhausting. 

Now I look forward, and pray to God that GOW Ragnarok and Sniper Elite 5 are good, I'm currently playing through sniper elite 4 rn, and somehow this 6 year old game has a stealth system 50 times better than the new gen games. Anyway, I just needed to vent, if you guys have any recommendations for PS5 games feel free to send them my way.",,1653332929

PS5,uw1qgd,Just walked in and got one.,"Managed to snag the H:FW edition at my local GAME store. My PS4 is now restoring and ready to sell. 

So, where I am just now I'm using a decent 27' 1080p gaming monitor, have access to 4k TV but not too fussed about that just now. Anyway, obviously I'm going to install Horizon, Astro and fuck around with all the new features. 

But, what I'm really looking forward to is the loading times/frame rate for my PS4 games like: TLOU2, Spider-Man, Death Stranding (I'm going to try again to enjoy it), Bloodborne, and a slew of other PS4 games until I eventually go online again and everything else when I move out of here. 

Any settings I should sort upon set-up that I may not know coming from PS4, or is it all easy enough to navigate through?

(Thought I‚Äôd make a guide cause none of the methods on YouTube or here worked for me)

Step 1: 

Go onto PlayStation remote play app on your phone and connect to your PS5

Step 2:

While using the buttons on screen to control, go to *settings* at the top of right of your screen

Step 3:

Go to *accessories*, next go to *general*,  next goto *bluetooth accessories*

Step 4:

Delete the controller(s) you cannot connect

Step 5:

Hold down Ps button + Share button at the same time. Your controller should start flashing.

Step 5: 

Under *accessories found* category your gonna see your controller pop up. Click on it and it will connect

Hopefully this worked for you, stupid problem to have. I didn‚Äôt have time to buy a new charger for my remote. So I tried everything and this is the only thing that worked for me. Just used my phone as a remote to get to the Bluetooth category so I can connect it that way.",,1653295438

In short, I‚Äôve envisaged two possible paths for your upcoming programming which I consider ideal, and I‚Äôd like to share them with you:

Either you put every King‚Äôs Field game on PS Plus Premium with hardware-correct speed and trophies, or you‚Äôll be having a surprise Gran Turismo Miata ND crossover event in the lobby of one of your Santa Monica offices.

I just recently got HFW, although it‚Äôs beautiful graphically, I enjoy more melee dominant based games, and I feel like this game heavily relies on ranged weapons.

Honestly my game collection has been dry for like a year and I was really bored and jumped the gun on HFW cause it looked dope (not saying it isn‚Äôt a great game, I just don‚Äôt enjoy the combat mechanics heavily favouring ranged weapons)

I‚Äôm looking for games with a 3rd person large open world with good combat mechanics that isn‚Äôt too hectic (Soulsborne games included) , I‚Äôve played and looking for something similar to:

Witcher 3
Ghost of Tsushima
Red dead Redemption 2
Spider man miles morales
AC Valhalla
The division
Days Gone
Last of Us 1 &amp; 2

To provide even more context, I‚Äôm excited to play (barring any flops ü§ûüèΩ):
Hogwarts Legacy
Forspoken
Black Myth Wukong

Got a PS5 to play games but realized I enjoy a certain set of games and there‚Äôs nothing out (that I know of) that honestly grabs my attention.

If you‚Äôve got any suggestion by all means drop some and I‚Äôd appreciate it.",,1653237242

I think it has something to do with the muscle deformation suits, which unfortunately has my favorite suit the Classic one. Apparently the deformation affects frame rate, and it seems to be true as the og suit u get (sportswear) runs perfectly fine.

The workaround mentioned there in which you view an existing HDR screenshot on the PS5 and then take a new PNG screenshot of it, seems to almost reach the quality as if it had been saved PNG originally. But only the HDR version viewed on the PS5 has the full HDR effect. I'm really wondering what image format the PS5 uses internally for HDR and if we will ever be able to copy that off the PS5. Also note that in my analysis, none of the sizes matched on the USB versus what the PS5 said they were.  


TLDR: Probably best to save PNG and lose HDR.",,1653164737

The fix:

I folded a paper towel. Wet it.  Wring it dry. Rub the corroded spring.  Then dry it. Remote should work instantly.  If you follow any of the PS official guides and deleted the remote from bluetooth, just renege to re-pair it.

I suspect this is due to them somehow pushing it up by releasing a similar game aka ""The Jumping Taco"" and the fact that there's already another release coming in 6 days called ""The Jumping Pizza."" Considering how low effort these games are and the fact that the new titles are literally pallet swaps, this garbage is shoving down actual indie games and preventing them from getting any real front page advertising on the PSN store.

While this is hardly the first game like this, it is the first to pump them out every week and abuse the system to push them to the top of the games list. There's only one real reason to buy this game too, and that's to inflate your trophy list and platinums, but even then ***what is the point.*** Trophies do absolutely nothing outside of comparing with other uses on a title by title basis, and even then this game sticks out more than a smut game like Waifu Impact.

The new HDMI port seems to working fine in terms of display but I now get some really pronounced input lag with my PS5 Controller. The problem goes away when its wired directly into the PS5 but is ongoing when my controller is connected wirelessly. 

My PS5 also seems to randomly disconnect my controller when connected wirelessly. I plan on going back to the repair shop tomorrow but was hoping for some ideas on what is wrong with it as i‚Äôm not able to find much info online.

Does anyone know if they will do this at all? I also know that via the Sony App, there is a setting for ‚ÄòAmbient Sound Control‚Äô, which also has a ‚Äòfocus on voice‚Äô checkbox. Would this do the job when the v-mods mic is attached for sidetone?

I'm currently using a 28"" UHD Monitor (U28R55) with the console if this makes any difference. 

Thanks.",,1653064379
PS5,utzyq4,Why does the PS5 never shut down after 3 hours in rest mode?,"So, I recently bought a new PS5 and I noticed that a distinct feature of the PS4 wasn't working on the 5.

After a game session I usely put my console in rest mode to charge my controller. I adjusted the energy settings so that my PS5 gives power to my controller for 3 hours. I didn't select the ""keep connected to the internet"" option, so my console should ONLY give power to my controller for 3 hours.

On the PS4, this option would mean that after 3 hours in rest mode, the console would turn itself off. Completely.

Why doesn't my PS5 turn off after 3 hours in rest mode? I don't want to keep my console in rest mode the whole night. Is there an option I'm missing?",,1653061564

PS5,utwmg7,The disc drive is a bane of the PS5 experience,"I love my PS5. It took me a long time to finally acquire one, but I finally got one, specifically the disc version.

One of the biggest improvements from the PS4 is the level of noise it makes. Its fan is very quiet, even when playing demanding games. The PS4 sounded like a jet taking off, the PS5 sounds like a small electric fan that you would use on a hot day. The problem, however, is the disc drive at times can completely shatter this improvement. The disc drive spinning at full speed, sounds just like a PS4.

The disc drive in the PS5 is a UHD Blu-ray player. The discs used can be up to 100GB in size. It makes perfect sense for it to spin at full speed when installing a new game, as installing a game as fast as possible is what we all want right? Of course. The problems with the disc drive is *after* the game has installed. There are 2 main problems:

**DRM**

This mechanism within the PS5 causes the disc drive to spin every so often when playing a disc based game. I‚Äôve never timed how frequently it does this, but let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs 45 minutes. So every 45 minutes when you‚Äôre playing your disc version of Elden Ring, you will hear the disc drive boot up at full speed.

The problem isn‚Äôt the DRM process itself, as obviously this mechanism needs to exist so that the console knows the disc is still legitimate and not pirated. The problem is with how fast the disc drive spins the disc. You would think that the disc drive would default to a much slower speed when checking for DRM. But no. It defaults to spinning at maximum speed, like you‚Äôre installing the game again.

This is incredibly inconvenient as if you‚Äôre playing your games at night and don‚Äôt want to disturb loved ones in your room or next door, it can potentially wake them. Why does it have to be this way? Imo, Sony should make it so that DRM checks run at a much slower speed as I don‚Äôt see the need to maximum speed for something so non-bandwidth heavy like a DRM check.

**Playing other games**

This is even somewhat more annoying than the previous issue. The PS5 decides to boot up the disc drive upon selecting a game that isn‚Äôt even the game you have on disc.

What do I mean? I have Elden Ring in my PS5, I select a digital game I have installed like Call of Duty: Vanguard, yet the disc drive still boots. How does this make sense? Why is Elden Ring spinning when I play a different game? It seems that Sony has programmed this too simplistic. The logic of the software is pretty much play game -&gt; DRM check disc, whereas it should ideally function as play *disc* game -&gt; DRM check.

This makes it frustrating when you‚Äôre trying to be quiet around loved ones at night. You think you‚Äôre safe playing a different game yet the disc drive decided to boot up anyways.

**Booting up the PS5**

Let‚Äôs say you want to avoid these issues at night, by watching Netflix. You have your loved one asleep nearby and you boot up your PS5 without selecting any game to avoid any audible noise from the disc drive or fan. Well tough luck, as the disc drive spins at full speed upon turning the PS5 on.

So no matter what you do, the PS5 will make a racket if you have a disc inside it. The current solution may be ‚Äújust take the disc out after using it‚Äù, but this isn‚Äôt the best solution. Ideally, the PS5 should assort to us, not us adapt to it. These inconveniences are all fixable by Sony. Besides, we all live busy lives at least some of do. We don‚Äôt all have our PS5s in the back of our mind with every living minute. Being forced to eject the disc at the start of every day so late night gameplay is quiet is inconvenient in itself.

Sony should improve this situation for disc users. There‚Äôs no reason the disc drive needs to spin at full speed upon booting up the PS5. There‚Äôs definitely no reason it should spin up at all when playing digital games. There‚Äôs no reason why it has to spin at full speed when performing DRM checks.",,1653054812

PS5,utfbcr,Looking for a couch co-op game I can play with my wife. Details inside!,"So my wife and I want to play a game together but haven't found something that fits what we are looking for.

We've played a good amount of It Takes Two and will eventually get to A Way Out, but are looking for something different. We've also played a lot of Gloomhaven digital on Steam, but am looking for something on PS. Portal 2 is on the list as well, but it's only PC as far as I know.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is what we are looking for:**

Couch Co-Op

No first person shooter, wife isn't a fan.

No top down, wife isn't a fan (Tried diablo 3 and what is what she didn't like). That being said, 3rd person would maybe be ideal, but first person is fine too. 

Preferably something where we can play the story together, not just rounds/challenges like overcooked which we've also played some of. 

Fantasy/Medieval is probably ideal, but open to other genres. 

Not super clunky. This is a weird one, but how smooth it all feels makes a big difference. If it feels like crap to play, my wife will give up rather quickly. 

Not too complicated RPG elements. I've played a lot of RPGs and MMOs and whatnot in my life but if there is too deep of a crafting or magic system, it loses my wife. For example, she tried The Witcher 3 and just found it to be too overwhelming to try and learn for someone who doesn't normally play that type of game. But I want some depth for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember we played some of an old lord of the rings game on PS2 that was great some years back but haven't found something that does all the same things. Something like a co-op Skyrim would be perfect. I know there is a mod for PC that we will try at some point. 

But any help or suggestions is appreciated.",,1653000783

Wasn't too sure if anyone else has had this experience.

I noticed when farming in Elden Ring awhile ago, now with Tiny Tina's duplicating Keys. 

Loading in, killing enemies in about 10 seconds, fast travel to beacon, rinse &amp; repeat.  
After a dozen or so times, it gets slower and slower at loading the fast travel.  
With Tiny Tina's I noticed every time I loaded in same thing the more I did it the slower it would load.

Talking from like 1.5-2 second loading, to 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5... Would always stop around it taking this long as I was happy where I was at, so not sure the extent this will go to or if anyone had has this issue or experimented with it either.

## i)LORE:

Horizon Forbidden west is longer most probably if considering only the cutscenes and total events that occur in the main storyline whereas Elden ring¬† story is shorter a little if you don‚Äôt do anything extra and get the 2 great runes only do the main questline so the rating according to the story of both : **Horizon 9.2 Elden ring 9.1 and remember the 2 stories are of different categories** one is fantasy future world and one is fully new fantasy world and one uses technology improvements and new AI‚Äôs whereas the other is based on becoming the Elden Lord and runes and great runes and both containing some interesting twists and in ELDEN RING you can change the ending whereas it‚Äôs not possible in HFW but you can change alloy‚Äôs personality and choices and be bold ,smart or kind are hear about everyone‚Äôs views and stories . for more [visit](https://whyconsole.com/2022/03/19/horizon-forbidden-west-vs-elden-ring-honest-personal-review/) and I mention there more good ones for 2022",,1652906866

Therefore, in the short term, we're going to be allowing sales number posts for *current-gen titles and consoles only*.  So the ever-popular Elden Ring and console sales threads would remain, but stuff like the latest numbers for RDR2 or The Witcher would go.

Second one has to do with disc games and is a bit specific. If I have a PS4 and a PS5, and let‚Äôs say I have a PS4 disc game installed on both, and I want to buy another copy of the same PS4 game, can I play the installed file simultaneously as long as a game disc is in both or does it have to be the one specific disc because it‚Äôs somehow coded into the console for it to run the file?

I can only replay the games in my library so many times and im hoping theres some hidden gem i dont know about and hopefully you know.

For perspective, I really would like to own all the PS5 exclusives as that is mainly what I bought it for. All other games I use my XSX. On the other hand, in the past I have played the Dishonored games and while I do enjoy them and think they are quite fun they were also always way to challenging for me to where I just lost interest in playing them maybe a 1/4-1/3 through. I have never played Prey so can't speak on that. But what I see of Deathloop and the whole idea of it has me to believe it would probably be a 9 or 10 game for me that I would actually finish.

So in your opinions how do you think it compares to their other titles in this aspect and do you think it is worth me giving a shot for the price tag currently?

Pros and cons of the game are all welcome too.

Thanks.",,1652882116

PS5,us8wxx,Speculated Weapons in God of war Ragnar√∂k and date of release," There is not much information available as to what weapons we‚Äôll be seeing in the new game, but as usual, speculations fueled by the God of war Ragnar√∂k trailer released by the Santa Monica team have been flying around. There are also a few speculations that were motivated mainly by Norse mythology.

**Leviathan Ax** ‚Äî This weapon which we first saw in God of War (2018), is making a comeback in the new series. Kratos wields it by flinging it and calling it back, holding his arm out just like Thor‚Äôs hammer. This video shows it in action.

 

**Gungnir** ‚Äî This weapon, also known as ‚ÄúThe swaying one‚Äù is a special spear used by Odin who made an appearance in God of war Ragnar√∂k. We‚Äôve heard rumours of Kratos claiming Gungnir for himself after defeating Odin in the game.

**Laevateinn** ‚Äî The wand-like weapon which is said to manipulate enemies from a distance. Although Kratos is not one to cast spells, the character who always resorts to using his muscles to fight his way out of any problem may use this weapon in the new game. Some have described this speculation as proof of how mature and refined the new Kratos character will be in God of war Ragnar√∂k.

One thing is for sure. The wait will be worth it. How do we know this? Cory Barlog, a producer on the team, on his Twitter page, celebrated the fourth anniversary of the critically-acclaimed God of War (2018). He also assured fans that his team is full of perfectionists who will stop at nothing to give us the best. That‚Äôs a bold statement considering how difficult it will be to deliver something better than the previous god of war games.",,1652866026
PS5,us8t4w,Aiming / Shooting with a controller: how did you get used to it?,"I'm terrible at aiming / shooting with the controller. I recently bought a PS5 and some of the games I'm more excited to try involve shooting, like Cyberpunk and Deathloop.

In the PS4, I abandoned Fallout 4 pretty early on, because I couldn't shoot and I kept dying every time I was attacked. I wanted to play it because I really liked Fallout 3 on the PC (I don't have a PC right now, PS5 is my only gaming option.)

I finished The Last of Us 1 with great effort and didn't like the experience because of how bad I am at shooting. So I'm not even considering playing TLOU2. Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time, but I played it with auto-aim. If it's available, I'll use auto-aim (Uncharted, Tomb Raider, RDR2).

But some games don't have the option for auto-aiming. I've watched some youtube videos, but even those seem to be directed to people who are not as bad as I am.

What should I do? Do you think I should play a pure shooter, something free like Apex Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, to improve until I feel comfortable enough to enjoy the single player games that involve shooting? How did you guys get used to aiming / shooting with a controller?",,1652865535

More than double that of the switch with similar hardware sales, Ps5 is doing also extremely well.

PS5,us7uwd,"Sony will be, one day, one of the richest companies in the world, thanks to Virtual Reality and gaming","Today, VR is only a small branch on a much bigger gaming tree. But one day, the metaverse will be reality and VR devices small and light. The metaverse sounds like a sci fi nightmare when Facebook is talking about it but in reality it‚Äôs basically social media 2.0. 

And imagine having then the best VR games and affordable technology. 

Microsoft is right when they say that there are 2 billion potential gamers out there. But you won‚Äôt reach them with Gamepass. Not even a Tv app available everywhere can reach 300 million. Not even the casual toaster also known as switch will achieve that. You need something that everybody wants. Like a phone. And VR combined with social media will one day be such a thing. Especially as soon as they are able to combine VR with phones and metaverse. 

Sony are not dumb and have an incredible sense for that. Alone how they changed the camera market on their own was brilliantly.",,1652861138
PS5,us7ork,"Why I think, A Ps5 handheld would have been better investment than VR","First context: 

People love to compare hardware sales. And it looks like, the switch will be one day the best selling system of all time. 

But! It‚Äôs not that simple. It not only matters how many you have sold but in what time. The switch will very likely exist til 2027 (because one of their leaders said it‚Äôs only at half of the life cycle atm). 

Nintendo Switch is the only money source for Nintendo. While Microsoft makes a lot and will even make a lot more money, from Pc as well. Sony moving to pc as well means that it‚Äôs better to have 2 money sources than 1. Because they have seen that pc and console gamers are completely different species ü§£. Not to forget that Microsoft will overall become a service brand not just a hardware based brand. 

It‚Äôs also important what kind of system the Switch is. The switch has basically no competition. While Microsoft has Sony and Sony has Microsoft. Sony and Microsoft make mostly games for mature people and core gaming while switch makes casual games for everybody (mostly). 

Yes is a difference and significant if you make a system for families or hardcore gamers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

Nintendo Switch Games can even be played by non gamers. Like mobile games. That‚Äôs what makes it so successful. But Imo, their games are mediocre at best (Mario and Zelda excluded). 

Their games are basically low budget titles my grandma can play why she is on her way with the bus. There is nothing wrong about that, but for the same reason the most successful movies, YouTube videos, games are family or casual products, for the same reason the switch is more successful than other brands. At least hardware wise. 

The Wii was stronger than Ps3 and Xbox 360 but sold much less games per console. Many people buy their systems for maximal 3 games (statistic). While for example ps3/4 had a 9-12 ratio. 

Many YouTubers and news outlets will just say System A sold better than System B, ignoring time, audience, software etc.

And here comes my point which has nothing to do with statics and math: 

I believe that Sony should start producing games like crash, spyro (of course new brands since Microsoft bought them, or will) etc again and then port those games to handhelds. Or just make handheld versions of them. Their studios often are working on 2-3 games at the same time. Why not letting them work on 1 casual and 1 core game? Ratchet, Sackboy would have been amazing casual on the go games. Even Returnal, a core game, would have been cool on the go. Sure, ratchet would not had the ssd trick with the rifts but imo, games can live without that as well. PlayStation has also an amazing lineup of old games which also would fit perfectly on a handheld. 

I know you think I just desperately want a Handheld and you‚Äôre right ü§£. Sony is wasting a huge potential here. Letting Nintendo dominate the market with underwhelming games just because there is nothing else. And no, Valves console is too big, too core, has no exclusives. It‚Äôs not a real competition. After the hype it will die out pretty soon. Will 100% not sell 100 million pieces lol. 

Anyway, let me know what you think.",,1652860353

That Super Sonic's final story's final boss was easy I had goosebumps! Even though it was a DX port (or DX remake) from the PC version it's all the same with or without the DX DLC upgrade! I had to record videos on my phone of Amy running to Sonic before She gives Him the emerald with and without subtitles! Amy's Story is short but I had to keep Her with that save file I have! I have to let go of the analog stick to stop Amy from sprinting (the one with the hammer) or I can press the action button to stop it to a hammer attack halt! The Chao races are fun when you take good care of the Chao in Chao Garden! Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are the ones I beat since I stopped playing it on a PS3 a decade ago! But when I come back to playing it on PSNow, boy I sure had a blast playing it! Amy's boots are rounded instead squared and I like them when She does alot of gameplay and cutscene animations from Her boots! I'm never gonna stop playing that game again! I can play it forever and ever and never stop! After I beaten the whole game I said ""So long Sonic Adventure on PSNow, bye."" and turned off the PS5! I really sure enough had a blast! Can't wait for Sonic Origins to come out next month.

PS5,ur1msf,Update on LG OLED B8 to C9 conversion,"Not long ago I created a Post about converting an OLED B8 TV to C9 by just swapping out the main board, WiFi module, and the magic remote.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg\_oled\_b8\_can\_be\_converted\_to\_a\_c9\_model\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/ukd22a/lg_oled_b8_can_be_converted_to_a_c9_model_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Now that I did the conversion I would like to give you an update:

1. **Getting the parts**  
This was actually easy. I searched eBay for those parts and ordered those which were the cheapest including shipping. 
2. **Preparation**  
I had to clean the new main board because it had metal flakes on the back. I guess the Italian workshop it came from is about recycling defective TV's and reselling parts. I did this with Isopropanol alcohol and a soft brush. I rinsed the main board with alcohol and then brushed off the metal flakes and residue. Only make sure to not flush out the cooling paste, but reapplying new one should not be an issue.   
Before doing the installation i factory reset my B8 TV in case I want to resell the main board and WiFi module, I would like to prevent someone else logging into my accounts.
3. **Installation**  
Literally all I needed was a Philipps PH1 screw driver. I recommend getting one with a magnetic tip. The hardest part was getting the back cover off, which is attached with clips to the rest of the TV. Then I had to remove all ribbon cables from the main board, unscrew it, replace it with the C9 main board, and put back the ribbon cables. Just make sure you unlatch the data cables properly and avoid ripping the off or ripping out the ribbon cable connectors. Replacing the WiFi module required unscrewing the whole fixture. The new WiFi module is smaller but fits perfectly well into the fixture. The new main board fit perfectly and all connectors are the same and in the same place.   
Worth noting: Since the (at least mine) B8PLA model already had a headphone jack, I din't need to unsolder it nor did I need to cut out a square hole into the back cover.
4. **Setup**  
After connecting the network, power, and HDMI cables I turned on the TV and it immediately greeted me in Italian language. I realized that the remote which came with my B8 model still works, but I used the new one since I already got it. Not sure if some functions won't work. Then it took me a little while change the language to English.   
First thing I did is factory reset the TV. I had to enter a 4 digit code to do so. My first guess 1111 worked, but after resetting the 4 digit code is actually 0000.  Setting up the TV was easy, and I immediately realized that it's faster.
5. **Testing with PS5**  
First the good news. PS5's screen settings info showed that 120Hz at 4K are supported and VRR is supported within a range of 48-120 Hz. 4K@120Hz works without an issue.  
Now the bad news. In Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition when testing at 4K 120 Hz with VRR on (aka Instant Game Response on C9) I had a black screen. In Ratchet and Clank I had partially a black screen. Not sure why this is. I would be interested if anyone else is having the same experience with their original C9 models.  


**TL/DR:** Converting my 55B8PLA to a 55C9MLB model was quite easy. Contrary to my previous post, I did not need a new remote. 4K@120Hz works but I am having black frames or completely black screen with VRR on.   


I will update this article if anything changes (e.g. after a PS5 or C9 update, or if I experience any issues).",,1652723123

You're receiving this email because you ordered DEATH'S DOOR from Special Reserve Games. We are just emailing you to inform you of a small delay; no action is necessary from you.

Over the last year we have been working to improve our warehouse operation, and bring as much of it in-house as possible. Right now, we are assembling DEATH'S DOOR Switch Reserves, and will be shipping them soon. Switch Singles will begin shipping on Monday.

We are seeing a delay on the PS5 games, which have to be assembled by Sony. We will be shipping Switch games shortly but we expect that PS5 games will experience a shipping delay of a couple of weeks. We still hope to be shipping them this month, but it's possible we might end up shipping them in the first week of June.

Many of the earliest orders for this game included both Switch and PS5 games. For these customers, we have set aside low-numbered Switch games to be packaged into their shipments later on when the PS5 games are ready to ship.

We just wanted to let you know this, and update everyone who ordered the game on its progress. Here are a few pics from the assembly floor. We're really pleased how the game name and Sarge's seal turned out!",,1652716098

PS5,uqvxg3,Ubisoft+ vs Ubisoft+ Classics,"I see a lot of people misunderstanding these two services, so I will try to put it in simpler words.
From Ubisoft News: https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/bPREDsvbMwS7wKIHlnVF1/ubisoft-coming-to-playstation 
&gt; Ubisoft+ will come to PlayStation in the future, bringing access to more than 100 titles, additional content packs, and rewards to the platform. The subscription service is currently available on PC, Stadia, and Amazon Luna, offering players day-one releases, classic games, and premium editions, and ultimately will be available on PlayStation and Xbox.

So, Ubisoft+ that's currently available on PC, Stadia and Luna will be coming to PlayStation store as a separate subscription service that will probably cost the same as on PC (15$). What's revealed today is a new Ubisoft+ subscription ""tier"" that's included with PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium.
&gt; Ubisoft also revealed that beginning May 24, it will launch a **new** Ubisoft+ subscription for PlayStation Plus called Ubisoft+ Classics. Ubisoft+ Classics on PlayStation is a **curated selection** of popular games, including top-selling Assassin‚Äôs Creed Valhalla, The Division, and For Honor, as well as beloved classic games like Child of Light, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, Watch Dogs, Werewolves Within, and more. The Ubisoft+ Classics catalogue for PlayStation Plus will launch with **27 titles and will grow to 50 by the end of 2022**

It will have 27 titles at launch and will expand to 50 by the end of the year. It won't have new releases (at least for now, we will have to wait), probably no DLCs too. We don't know if they will add new games after half or full year like EA+ on gamepass does as they don't state it anywhere (again, gotta wait). 

TLDR: Ubisoft+ with all new releases and DLCs is separate from PS+; Ubisoft+ Classics is included with PS+, but has 27 (later 50) older games.",,1652707525

If there is no audio then it's completely silent, so it's not a constant background noise. And if I turn the headphone volume down in the PS5 menu all the way to zero you can still hear the white noise. 

I have tried 3 different headphones and I have just got the store I bought the PS5 from to replace the Dualsense and the same issue. Also I don't get this noise when using a PS4 pad.

Is it mean to be like this or do I have a faulty PS5? The best way to test is to just by being on the home screen and navigating around. Turn off home screen music but leave on sound effects.

I don't want to send back my PS5 for an exchange if this is just the way it is meant to be.

Thanks",,1652704271

PS5,uqa6nc,Display area glitch with ps5 on A80J,"Hey guys, 

Just got the a80j in 77‚Äù screen size about a week ago and have been trying to use it with my ps5 but keep getting issues with sound and video.

I‚Äôll first explain the display area glitch. There are times where part of the video signal from the ps5 is cut off on the right or left side but the opposite side has just dead space‚Ä¶ just pixels that are turned off. Only way I have found to fix it is doing a hard restart of the tv. Restarting the PS5 did nothing in my case.

Now for the sound glitch. I have a Denon 3300 AVR but chose against using it because of how much sound lag there is with it. Problem is that if my PS5 is on and I try to switch my sound from external to internal tv speakers it introduces about 100ms of sound lag. So then I have to go into my ps5 sound settings and change it from PCM to DTS and then back to PCM. This reduces the sound lag coming from the tv speakers from about 150ms back down to 50ms. I can‚Äôt seem to figure out if it‚Äôs something with the ps5 or the TV that is causing this issue. 

Also why is there any lag at all when my ps5 is plugged directly into the tv, so the sound from the tv speakers should have zero delay but it still has about 50ms? Any input to enlighten me is very welcome. Thank you in advance",,1652633508

I clicked disconnect as instructed and the system popped back on the TV, but I could NOT get the controller to reconnect without walking to the PS5 and plugging it in.  Is that, as intended?

PS5,uq3uab,disc copies still expensive,"So I'm just wondering when do games actually go on a decent sale - mainly talking about ghost of Tsushima here. 

It's ¬£70 for a digital copy of it and it's around ¬£55 for a disc copy on Amazon. I checked used copies and it's around ¬£40-50. So I'm just wondering does this game ever go on sale? It's been out for like 2 years(?) And it's still being sold next to full price pretty much. But there's other games that have been released for around the same time and are now less than ¬£20 (AC Valhalla). Why is that? 

I remember before I used to buy new copies for ¬£40 on release and now I can barely get a used copy for that much depending on the game even a year or two later. I know there's a lot of factors that go into it but it kinda sucks.",,1652613003

If not, is there guaranteed way I could temporarily fix it for at least one gaming session?

PS5,upqrug,got a ps5 today n got to say i was blown away by the most unlikely game....,"been gaming for over 30 years from the high profile arcades, from my first ever machine the spectrum zx sinclare and everything since,  sorta been shoe horned into the xbox family since the 360 purely because the ps3 got delayed so much , when i did eventually get a ps3 i was very underwhelmed, the ps4 iv had for a while and always been impressed with the exclusives, i stood by my guns and said (being an mainly an xbox gamer) that nothing on the alternate consoles looked even as good as infamous 2nd son....

&amp;#x200B;

iv gone through every iteration of the xbox since the 360, and since the one X was release iv always stood by my own opinion and even owning the series S and X when MS boasts they have the most powerful console available , yes thats all well and good to claim it but show me ..... and iv had both the Series Consoles the S over a year the X since Xmas and they are both nice and shiny but iv missed that new gen feeling, when you upgraded to ps2 and you saw GTA3 for the first time it dropped your jaw, when RDR dropped your brains flew out , when you played mario 64 it was like omfg what is this devilry. but since then iv had nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

today i picked a ps5 up from the most unlikely place and all the way home was like eesh should i have bought this, loaded it up and i had 2 new gen games to impress me, horizon being the game i was expecting to be amazing..... but then the one that never expected anything from at all or even heard of which i instantly fell in love with and not only did i expect nothing from but made me fall back in love with nostalgia and gaming again ......... the astro game...

&amp;#x200B;

It hits every nail on the head, simplistic gaming, charm, amazing sound, the nostalgia of many years of gaming , great graphics, fun gameplay, it just took me back through 30 years of gaming and doesnt try to be anything special or standout it just hits all the basics that so many games miss these days, it looks nice yes but its no nawty dog game or whatever but as someone who has been gaming years upon years and got lost in graphics, or addicted to achievements or whatever other fad has come along , gaming at its heart has become lost for being what its meant to be and thats fun........ this game brought it all back and id say for any developer and especially MS who have tried to shove yukaleele or however its spelled and recore or all this fails mascots down our throats take a note this game blew my mind in ways it shouldnt...

&amp;#x200B;

anways iv waffled enough iv had a beer but yeh any buyers remorse i had instantly went away with this game and even though its a fkin unit of a machine and iv had to build an extension to get it in my house, ps5 has made me do what no console has done in years..... and thats fall in love with it instantly...",,1652563517

PS5,upifkt,Wired Headphones Not Detected?,"Hey all,

As of a few hours ago, my controller does not seem to detect any (wired) headphones.

Whenever I plug a pair of headphones into my controller, they are simply not detected. I have tried multiple different pairs but none of them seem to work (despite all previously working). When I go to my sound settings, the audio output is still via the HDMI cable - as if no headphones were even detected in the first place.

This is especially annoying because just two weeks ago, I returned my controller to Sony for a repair - it just gave up and stopped working (random inputs, unresponsive buttons etc.). I only received it back a few days ago but everything seemed to be working fine (the only thing I noticed is that pressing touchpad sounded a bit flimsy).

Has anybody else experienced this? Is there a fix or should I just return the controller *yet again*?",,1652538616

PS5,updru6,PS5 hardly read my disc,"Hi all,

So I have a PS5 with built-in optical drive however I'm usually purchasing games digitally.

Now -after finishing Elden Ring - I've got the idea to play Sekiro again.

I have a physical copy. (This is the first disc I'm trying to insert since I've got the console last may)

So I just inserted the disk, the drive spinned for like 2 seconds and I've got the error that the disc cannot be recognized.

I've tried it again and again.

After a while, I was able to install the game from disc, however, since the installation, the game is not booting and the PS don't recognize the disc again. 

Console is laying horizontally (I've read somewhere that the standing position might cause these issues, it's not the case here)

The disc is near perfect condition, as I've used it only once or twice on PS4 (2-3 hours of game time maximum), I've cleaned it with microfiber tissue, tried to reboot the PS, even from safe mode, rebuild the database, etc... System software is up to date. Nothing seems to help.

What do you think? Has anyone encountered this same issue? 

My biggest concern is, that somehow I was able to install the game from the disc, but before and after, it's non-recognised again.

What do you think, might it be a hardware issue? Dust in the optical drive, etc?",,1652521150

PS5,up1esn,"In my (limited) experience, PS5 games look more crisp on a 1080p screen because many don't hit true 4K at 60fps.","I've had my PS5 for about a year, and I've been playing it on a 1080p 60hz TV the entire time. The picture is crisp and from the distance I'm at, it looks great!

I took my PS5 to a friend's house that has a 4K TV and the image for a few games I tried was just not as good. It was blurrier in my opinion.

Doing some research since then I'm finding that there aren't that many games that run at a true 4K 60 on the PS5. Many are checkerboard or dynamic resolution which doesn't quite hit 4K, or they're 1440p at their performance mode. Often the quality mode is native 4K but runs at 30fps which I don't like. So many games seem to be upscaled to 4K which doesn't look as good as native and it appears blurry to me after seeing them on a 1080p screen.

Seems like all of this, on a 1080p screen creates a better picture because it's either native resolution or higher and it's downscaled nicely to 1080p.

To play games at 60fps and retain a crisp resolution, seems like upgrading from a 1080p TV isn't really a good idea with this console. Happy to be proven wrong on the technical details of the games, but that's my experience so far.  I'm sure there are well optimized exceptions out there and yes, the performance mode probably makes other visual sacrifices. But I'm talking about purely resolution and FPS as that's what looks ""good"" to my eyes.

I kinda expected more from PS5 but it seems like the trend will be in the direction of more 30fps titles if we want native 4K. Do you think developers will push to optimize for 4k 60 as the console matures, or do you think they'll pack in as much expensive visuals as they can and just cap it at 30?",,1652475870

I was playing a game yesterday, and within an hour, my hand was getting sore. From the tip of my thumb to the wrist, it's still a bit... off. I've had the console for quite some time, and this is not the first time it's happened. It's no fluke, being a consistant problem. I've never had this issue with a controller before, and have usually been a fan of the PS controllers (DS2 and 3 being favourites). As much as I like the new features, I don't think I'll be booting up a game on the PS5, until I can get a different controller.

So, if you've used them, which would you recommend for smaller hands? Bonus points if it doesn't have that annoying Share button (I keep hitting it, thinking it's Select... that musicle memory is still strong).",,1652449618

3. The protagonist has to utilize something shown earlier to achieve success.

Persona 5: &gt;!When you finally get to the interrogation room, and it looks like Akechi kills you, but he was really sent to the metaverse. !&lt;

Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness:&gt;! When Strange loses the girl America and then has to possess the zombie corpse. !&lt;

Spider-Man Homecoming: &gt;!When Peter finds out Liz's dad is the vulture, and has to lift the lockers to get his spider suit. !&lt;

I just unboxed my new ps5, and when I was prompted to download and install the system update I did, and it said the system would restart afterward but it never restarted. I tried manually turning it on but it sent me to the repairing console storage screen. it gets to 100% on there and then shuts off, doesn't restart. I turn it on again and it's stuck in a loop of repairing console storage. 

I tried safe mode but it just made me sit through the download again for it to fail to restart. 

any help?

I seem to be in the minority for whom the new controller causes hand pain (escalating from mild to severe). I'd love to be able to, like, actually play PS5 games on my PS5.

I came across an article mentioning remote play, but I don't understand this sentence:  
""In fact, you can skip game streaming altogether and just play on the TV your PS5 is connected to, using remote play as a sort of controller interpreter.""

Can anyone interpret? Thanks!",,1652295742

PS5,un5stb,"My fellow sports games fans, which of the upcoming soccer games are you most excited for?","So, by now, we know that we are entering a pretty wild and weird time for fans of the beautiful game. For years now, soccer games have been almost exclusively just FIFA and PES. Both required the yearly $60ish investment for mostly a roster update and maybe a couple new features and gameplay upgrades.

In the (hopefully near) future, we the gamers will have at least 5 new games to choose from! Those games will be EA Sports FC, FIFA's rival to EASFC, eFootball, UFL and GOALS. The latter 3 are/will be free to play which I assume that EASFC and its rival will continue to do yearly releases at a $60ish price point.

Personally, I've already given up on FIFA, so EASFC and it's rival aren't for me. I'm excited to see where these other companies choose to take the idea of a soccer game. It will be very interesting to see what sort of features, animations, game modes, etc get included in order to give each game its own unique feel.

eFootball is already available for free and while it's definitely rough around the edges (and there honestly isn't very much content right now) it's a nice change of pace from what FIFA is. Over time I'm sure it'll get even better to compete with FIFA, at least in the short term.

All that being said, I just wanted to find out which of these y'all are most excited for. For me, it's GOALS! On paper, they seem to have a ridiculously cool concept and I think if they manage to pull it off and simultaneously deliver a game that feels satisfying to play, then they'll run away with the market. If you haven't already, definitely check them out to see what sort of ideas they're wanting to bring to the table! Share your thoughts on how you think the soccer game landscape will change in the coming months/years!",,1652260833

PS5,umwg0y,"TLOU pt1 is one of the best role playing games ever, in the truest sense of the word.","I love an action RPG. I finished the mass effect trilogy. I saw my choices affect the final outcome. I finished the Fallout games, Witcher, Skyrim, Diablo, Outer Worlds, all the Soulsborne games and many more action RPG's. I enjoyed them all but I never felt like there was an emotional weight behind my choices and actions, I never truly felt like I was *playing the role* of the main character. 

By the last act of TLOU pt1 I realised I felt something I hadn't experienced before in a video game - I *really cared* what happened to Ellie. I felt a weight of responsibility I couldn't explain.  I don't know if it's down to the brilliant writing, pacing and voice acting or something else, but no other game has truly made me feel like the decisions I made as the the main character really *mattered* like this one did. 

I think sometimes when you're creating something you can very occasionally stumble upon a magical combination that is far greater than the sum of it's parts, and Naughty Dog caught lightning in a bottle with the way they constructed Joel and Ellie's unfolding relationship.

This is why my truest 'role playing' experience to date came from an action adventure game that isn't even technically an RPG.",,1652227100

Also I know that all my Aussie bought PS5 games will work on the console when I bring it over, as well UK PS5 bought games. But will I be able to buy DLC in the UK for UK bought PS5 games? Or purchase DLC for my Aussie bought PS5 games in the UK? I know you can't change your PSN region so I know I'll be still functioning under the AUS store. But I just want to know that I will be fine buying UK PS5 games and to be able to download stuff for those games (or any other apps from the store) whilst living in the UK.

All and all, will my PS5 function in the UK if bought in Australia? And will I be able to download DLC for UK bought PS5 games. Essentially will my PS5 function identically as it does in Australia?

I've contacted support and even wrote them a note along with my hardware asking them to please replace my console instead of repairing it since I'm uncertain about the future of my console's lifespan and I didn't want to pay for out of pocket charges for an initially faulty console.

I've tried opening the machine up and adjusting the drive screw clockwise with a disc in until it is ejected manually. A much shorter/milder version of this noise early on was fixed by that technique, but it doesn't work now.

PS5,uly541,PS5 connectivity issues,"Bought the console back in November and ever since I‚Äôve been having issues with the wifed connection.

I can‚Äôt play Warzone and I keep getting disconnected every 1-2 mins in Elden Ring, it works on Apex, but for it to work, in-game Apex has to say it‚Äôs unable to connect to the internet (Code 100 i think id the error) and then it manages to connect snd work flawlessly from there on.

While downloading I‚Äôve had issues where it sometimes just stops downloading and/or downloads veeeery slowly, but sometimes it downloads flawlessly.

I have two wired connections that I‚Äôve created, let‚Äôs call them 1 and 2, 1 is the wired connection that the Playstation automatically created and 2 is the one that i manually created when i searched my router info on my PC, for instance, 1 works perfectly on Apex but won‚Äôt work on other games, 2 works on other games but won‚Äôt on Apex.

I called my ISP months ago when these issues were first bothering me and they said that they don‚Äôt see any issues and that it‚Äôs probably my PS5‚Äôs fault, i called the shop where i bought the PS5 they told me it probably isn‚Äôt the PS5 that‚Äôs faulty since they didn‚Äôt have anyone return their PS5 because of this issue, *but* some people have already complained about the same thing.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I literally cannot play Warzone, it‚Äôs not able to connect at all, i keeps disconnecting from Elden Ring, but if i connect via Wifi every game works perfectly, which tells me that there obviously is an issue with the wired connection",,1652121854

But I‚Äôm a bit concerned that games from the PS1 era that have voice acting will be difficult for them to get the rights to. 

As I understand it, contracts for voice acting were different back in the day and only provided rights to the voices for a certain amount of time. So if the company wanted to re-release a game now that had voices, they would have to draw up new contracts with the entire voice cast and pay them for usage again. However, I haven‚Äôt used PS Now before, so I was curious: Are there any PS1 games currently on the service that have voice acting?",,1652116505

PS5,ulsz8w,Disappointing Longevity of DualSense Controller,"Going into the second year of the PS5's life cycle, I'm curious as to how many people out there with launch or near-launch systems still have fully functioning DualSense controllers. 

I got my PS5 in February of 2021, and as of April 2022 my DualSense is completely unusable. The first issue popped up around 6 months in when something snapped in my right trigger that caused the trigger to become very loose and sensitive to even the slightest amount of pressure. This was annoying, but it didn't seem to effect the adaptive trigger functionality and ultimately I got used to dealing with it. A couple months later, the same thing happened to the left trigger.

The biggest issue began this year when the dreaded stick drift started to kick in on the right stick. It started off pretty mild but it's progressed to the point now where it's so severe that I am totally incapable of playing any game that uses the right stick. Keep in mind that I take extremely good care of all of my tech. I cleaned the DualSense regularly, never played rough with it and never even dropped it, and the amount of time that I regularly used it would be considered moderate to low by most standards.

I am fairly disappointed that the ""future of gaming controllers"" has barely lasted me a year of use. This stings even more considering that my launch Dualshock 3 still works perfectly.",,1652107875

Don't get me wrong it was fun and a different experience to most games, but I thought I'd just scratched the surface and the concepts introduced early on would then open up and evolve as the game progressed.

PS5,uldvwp,What let PS Now down?,"With the new PS Plus service rolling out soon, I was just wondering what caused PS Now to be so poorly received. 

It did have a good collection of games, but was let down by the streaming. MK9 for instance is unplayable due to the latency and lag even on a super fast connection. &amp; since it's a PS3 game it can't be downloaded. 

Downloaded games are great and work like a charm, but only being able to stream games that were older than the PS3 kinda sucks, although understandable.

Very few 1st party games come on PS Now, and only recently have they started to join the service at all. However I really don't see this as a bad thing as it keeps the quality of the games high (most anyway). Adding Returnal is honestly very generous of them. 

The thing is, I don't see many things changing with the new PS Plus Premium service. PS3 games still won't be downloadable, streaming will most likely still be crap and won't be improved any time soon, and there'll be a lack of 1st party games (which is honestly what I prefer, but others will understandably argue against it). 

The addition of PS5 games will help a lot, but people who weren't interested in PS Now previously, most likely won't be after either (excluding everyone who's converting to years of PS Plus Premium for a few quid lol)",,1652052053

But I can't find any reviews or comments compare the 3D audio feature for the headphones or say that one has better 3D over the other. Has anyone who has tried both noticed any difference in the 3D audio?

I've also read that apparently any headphones will have 3D audio for PS5, but I have a decent pair of Sennheiser headphones for music that I plug into the 3.5mm jack on the controller, but I don't notice anything special. It just sounds like regular old stereo, and I can really only distinguish either left or right, nothing for behind or in front. I have the 3d audio option on in the settings menu, and I've tried out the various customization settings. Is 3D audio just marketing hype?

PS5,ul6yh3,The Last of Us 2,"I finished this game probably a few months ago and I was reading some reviews and interpretations of the game, and I came to discover that I seem to be in the minority. I loved the Last of Us. The storytelling is fantastic, the gameplay is beautiful, and the world immersive. If given a choice at the end, to sacrifice Ellie or to save her, then I would choose to save her every time! If I was stuck in an apocalyptic environment like their world, and the only semblance of joy in life was a relationship rekindled by and with a child, then I would never let that go, not for the whole world. The Last of Us 2 presented a very reasonable series of consequences for Joel‚Äôs choice in the first game, but I just can‚Äôt seem to care or root for Abby. I don‚Äôt support her or anything about she tries to accomplish. I understand that the writer‚Äôs intention was to display the cycle of violence and voracious appetite of vengeance, but as an audience member of the first game, I was essentially born into the family of Joel and Ellie. Seeing my cherished characters suffer at the hands of a stranger, and then being forced to sympathize with that stranger left me with distaste. Even if it meant destroying hundreds of others‚Äô lives, I would never sacrifice my family for a potential cure to the plague. I would choose violence every time.

PS5,uk54yh,"Are PS5 Discs Getting Thinner? Certain discs not ejecting, probable cause?","Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a bit of a weird question, but I'm having trouble ejecting game discs from my PS5. But the catch is that they're only certain ones and that they're fairly new releases.  


I had an issue a couple weeks ago where FNAF Security Breach wouldn't eject from my console. After many a struggles and confusion from the Playstation support article (and having to eventually grab a second, flatheaded, screwdriver) I was able to get it out. Got everything working fine, put in a couple other games (F1 2021 and Spider Man Miles Morales to be precise) to see if the issue was fixed. Seemed to be fixed, no problem. Neither game had issues ejecting.  


Flash forward to tonight and I'm wanting to play F1 2021. So I go to eject the game that was in the disc drive - which was Lego Star Wars Skywalker Saga. Same issue happened with that game as with FNAF a couple weeks back. Well no problem, I just do what I did a couple weeks ago, and it comes out fine. Again I try putting F1 2021 in and ejecting it out to see if my problem has been fixed. It looks like it has because F1 2021 comes out fine.   


For the heck of it, I put Skywalker Saga back in and try to eject it again, only to have a worse issue trying to eject it than I did the first time where I just hear a cranking noise, as if the screw to manually remove the disc was being used. I quick turn off my system and get it so that I can get the game out, and I do, fine and all. So then I get everything working again and try Spider Man again, and it comes out fine.  


So at this point I take out Spider Man and compare it to the Skywalker Saga, and I'm not sure if it's just me, but it almost seems like the Skywalker Saga disc is just a tad bit thinner than the Spider Man disc. Could this be causing any potential issues for disc ejection on the PS5? Or are the discs the same size and I'm just losing my mind?  


TL;DR - Certain discs won't eject from PS5, they *appear* to be thinner. Are they? If so, is that what's causing an issue?",,1651896382

It's due to bandwidth limitations forcing the ps5 into YCbCr422. As of now I'm unsure if there's more to it such as audio downgrades etc BUT Sony said a while back (I believe on Twitter?) that when/if the HDMI bandwidth became an issue it would or could be fixed. 
Can anyone add to this anything more recently said or indications of time frame or if maybe it can't really be done? RN even 4k120 hdr forces the system to lose image quality without VRR even, never mind that 8k tag on the ps5 üì¶ üôÑ

PS5,ujnw32,What are some games you have tried to get into multiple times but they just didn‚Äôt click for you?,"I have a few. Lots of words inbound. 

1.	Dying Light, 3 tries. Furthest I‚Äôve made it was to the 3 air drops or some shit. Something about this game‚Äôs graphics that I just hate. Maybe it‚Äôs the motion blur or something but I can‚Äôt stand it. I also simply don‚Äôt like how underpowered you feel and that the only way to deal with zombies is to run away. Yeah the parkour is cool but I play a zombie game to play with zombies not run around them and ignore them completely. And even when you do fight them, using wooden sticks and a pipe while standing on a car is boring. There‚Äôs a mission early on where you have to beat up some human enemies that stole medicine or some shit. You are so underpowered at this stage that the ONLY way to fight all 7 of them and not immediately die is to run in, punch one of them one or two times, get your ass beat within an inch of your life, run away to regen health, then rinse and repeat until they‚Äôre all dead. Also the controls layout is super obtuse. People keep telling me to stick with it but I can‚Äôt make it more than a few hours before getting bored. 
2.	Death Stranding, 2 tries. Furthest I‚Äôve made it was to the first time you have to steal back stuff from the orange guys I don‚Äôt remember what they‚Äôre called. This makes me sad because I REALLY want to like this game; I enjoy the premise and taking a break from those non-stop action games sounds great but I really hate how the first few hours are basically 95% cutscene and 4% reading about the game and how it works. I know that‚Äôs par for the course with Kojima but still. I enjoy navigating the terrain and the online stuff but it‚Äôs just information overload with how much text pops up in your screen before, during, and after every single delivery and the game makes no effort to explain anything to you other than basic gameplay and even then it does a horrible job. There‚Äôs a part in the beginning where it starts to rain and by this point you know that rain is bad so you want to hide from it. During this delivery, the game very deliberately puts a small cave directly in your path seemingly for you to hide in. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù you think. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just wait here for a bit for the rain to stop.‚Äù WRONG. Turns out that this rain is scripted and will not stop until you keep going and rain does not become a dynamic part of the game until much later. I learned this after sitting in that cave and doing literally nothing for 2 hours while waiting for the rain to stop and upon googling, turns out MANY people did this as well. Not a great start. The UI is a mess and packed with information that‚Äôs difficult to parse. And the acting/script is just bad. Very bad. Maybe this was acceptable years ago but we‚Äôre in a post TLOU, GoW era of gaming. Shitty acting and mediocre dialogue in a top-tier AAA game is just not acceptable anymore ESPECIALLY in a game that has the cast that DS does. 
3.	Final Fantasy 15, 3 tries. Furthest I got was to the boat/beach after fixing the car. I‚Äôm not an FF guy and 15 was the first one I ever played. This shit sucks. How fucking lame is it that you can‚Äôt drive the car and it‚Äôs on-rails? The combat feels so outdated and‚Ä¶ airy? It feels like you‚Äôre hitting enemies with a feather and they hardly even react to what you do to them. Magic feels like ass, the AI for enemies and your homies doesn‚Äôt do shit, the quests are boring as hell. Dialogue and acting is just horrendous. I realize again this is typical for these games but somehow FF7 Remake is exactly the same but still manages to be miles better in this regard? That game I didn‚Äôt finish but that‚Äôs because I got distracted with TLOU2 and I‚Äôve been meaning to go back to it. 
4.	Horizon Zero Dawn, furthest I got was about 2-3 hours in. Let me start by saying the game itself isn‚Äôt bad. What I don‚Äôt like about it is the Ubisoft-style open world. I HATE games that litter your map with a bunch of shit to do. If Elden Ring had done this I would not have played it but it didn‚Äôt and that simple change makes exploring and doing quests so much more gratifying. I just can‚Äôt stand a game that throws a bunch of what are basically checkboxes for you to do and doesn‚Äôt let you organically discover them or complete quests, again like Elden Ring. I also hate games that force you to forage for crafting materials to make weapons and ammo types and all that and HZD does exactly this. Again, Elden Ring is the gold standard here. You don‚Äôt NEED to do it but if you want to, just walk over to the thing and press triangle and that‚Äôs it. No long ass animation, no 2-3 dialogue boxes to get through, no annoying sounds or anything, just press the button and get the thing. It‚Äôs funny because my GF just beat this game and she loves it. I can‚Äôt bring myself to play it, it feels like a chore. Which sucks because it looks beautiful and the gameplay itself is superb. It‚Äôs everything else leading up to the gameplay that I don‚Äôt like. 
5.	Red Dead Redemption 2, 2 tries. Furthest I got was  rescuing that one dude from the small prison somewhere in Valentine? This game man, I just can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt play it. Your dude feels so HEAVY and slow to do anything. That‚Äôs literally the only thing that stops me. I can‚Äôt stand taking 3 years just to turn around or get on your horse or harvest a deer you just killed or loot a building or dead body. I can‚Äôt do it. I realize that‚Äôs the appeal of the game, the immersion and the slow pace and all that but for me, it doesn‚Äôt work. I wish this game had an ‚Äúimpatient mode‚Äù where it would just cut out all those animations and deliberate wait times and just instantly do the thing. Then I‚Äôd be able to play it. Other than that, 10/10 for everything else. I really want to experience the seemingly amazing story but I cannot bring myself to wait for the hours of animations to get there. 
6.	Warzone. These types of games are lame without friends and I don‚Äôt have a consistent squad. And trying communicate with people in pubs is just a horrible experience. People are either rude, annoying, bad teammates, or shit at the game. I‚Äôve not had 1 single positive experience playing with randoms. I really want to play this and be into Warzone but again all my friends are on Fortnite and while I enjoy that too, sometimes I want a different BR experience. Side note: Fortnite no-build more is actually amazing. 

That‚Äôs everything. I‚Äôm bored at work so yeah lol what do y‚Äôall think? What games have you tried to play that just didn‚Äôt work for you?",,1651844940

Over 14000 people is inside the waitlist. Now they are giving people in 2021 early Feburary at this moment. I'm in a small country so games doesn't sell well here.

PS5,uje6is,Are variable or ‚Äúcontextual‚Äù resolution modes possible?,"When I‚Äôm playing Horizon and get into **combat**, I turn on **60fps** and turn off fidelity 4K mode. 

When I‚Äôm playing Uncharted Remastered, I play 60fps performance mode, but stop to change all **cinematics** to **4k30fps**.

If feasible, I hope the next step for developers will be providing variable modes for those with the screens that can utilize the enhancement.

However, for some I understand there could be irritation from the switching. Also. some games let you pause to change the resolution and some need a restart, so I‚Äôm not sure how much of a challenge this could be. 

Imagine playing Horizon and exploring in 4k30 and then when a combat begins, you go back to the variable4k60fps combat. I‚Äôm sure there could even be a ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù when the game knows you are leaving combat for good or may run into encounters again quickly. 

It could help reduce the suddenness of the frame-rate switch. When the games know you‚Äôre going to be exploring a town, it‚Äôs going to make sure it‚Äôs 4k30. If you just left cleared a cave in 1800p/60fps combat, and the next location on your map 100m away isn‚Äôt cleared, it might as well not go back to 4K30fps pretty mode until you‚Äôre really done with the bad guys in the area. 

For cinematics, I‚Äôm surprised this isn‚Äôt always an option. I don‚Äôt know if any of this would work for open word games, but I wanted to get the idea out there for discussion.",,1651806807

I feel like ive tried everything under the sun, rebuilding it, resetting it, changing settings resseting the controller resseting my router and still nothing. at this point idfk know what to do. i bought this so i could play the new spiderman game coming out since itll only be on ps5 but im thinking about seeing if i can get a refund anyway. this is such bullshit",,1651800444

PS5,uj8f21,Do you think there will ever be true user-progression between a game and it's sequel(s)?,"I'll use the Horizon series as an example. Imagine you can import your HZD save data into HFW and it can read what armor, weapons, etc. you had equipped during your last save. Then you start HFW with the same build you had at the end of HZD, even if it's purely cosmetic. It would really feel like you're continuing the same story, playing the same ""version"" of Aloy that you spent all that time with in HZD. I can't be the only one that's sometimes wondered ""why, in this sequel, is the character basically starting back at square 1"" in terms of armor, weapons, skills, etc.

An even deeper idea is if the game is able to tell from the save data which side quests were completed in HZD. Then when meeting the recurring characters in HFW, if you completed their quests in HZD they greet you as an old friend, and if not then they introduce themselves as if they haven't met before. It would really create a unique experience for each individual player based on what they chose to do or not do in the previous game while also making it less immersion-breaking if someone is familiar with the main story but may not have played the first game before jumping into the second. 

Do ya'll think this kind of progression will ever exist? Games can already scan for a different game's save data in general and give items/rewards, so I guess it's more of a question of what data is accessible within the save file itself and if devs can take advantage of that and build it in?",,1651787919

I have only had a PS2 &amp; a PS3, and when I used the PS3 controller the battery lasted for days. I just don‚Äôt know if most users at least are having the same issue, or if this is expected or a normal behaviour even maybe on PS4? Idk‚Ä¶ should I make use of the warranty?

Firmware is updated on the headset and if I manually go to settings and specify audio out to the surround system, then I don't get the constant disconnect notification. It's enough of an inconvenience that I'm complaining about it. 

I don't want to have to go into the menu or pull out a USB dongle that's easy to lose. When I shut off the headset on my series X it doesn't try to keep connecting to it.

PS5,uigla9,PS Plus Revamp coming to Asian markets soon,"Hey everyone, I hope y'all are having a great day :D

I am making this post because it just came to my mind that the PS Plus revamp is about to be launched into the Asian markets in about 2 weeks and a bit: 

* Asia markets (excluding Japan) ‚Äì targeting May 23, 2022
* Japan ‚Äì targeting June 1, 2022
* Americas ‚Äì targeting June 13, 2022
* Europe ‚Äì targeting June 22, 2022

Now, we still have ***NO IDEA*** what sort of games will be included in the subscriptions and Sony seems to be **VERY** quiet recently. Do y'all think they will just do a blogpost about the games or they may do a mini State of Play to showcase some of the big games coming into the service (aside from Spiderman &amp; Spiderman Miles Morales, Returnal, God Of War etc...) soon?

I have a HDD from my PS4, that's a WD Passport 4TB. From what I understand I can easily plug it in to the PS5 and have access to my PS4 games, but what about storing PS5 games on it? 

Do PS5 games only store to SDD? 

If I connect the HDD to the PS5, can I download PS4 games directly to it from the PS Store?

If I was to get a SDD, would it store both PS4 and PS5 games to the same device?

Basically I got the 4TB so I could go all digital with my games esp because of the PS Plus games that drop monthly, I download them whether I play them or not, with now about 100 games on it. I wouldn't mind upgrading to a SDD but I don't want to have to bounce back and forth if I don't have too. Like I said I've done research and get conflicting results with articles that are dated from from the time the PS5 came out and can't seem to find anything about the current status of the HDD/SDD situation so anyone more knowledgeable please chime in.

PS5,uhzp3t,This console generation is lame so far,"I spent 6 months hunting down a PS5 and finally got one in June of 2021. I‚Äôm not sure if I was more excited about getting to play with the new toy or if I was relieved to have secured one, thereby allowing me to close the 24-hour alarm youtube feeds, stop scouting for drops, and quit getting my hopes up and destroyed in morale-crushing online shopping carts. I paid 650 for this sucker, but it came from a very secure source so I felt is was worth the price. I have used it every day for the past year almost, and I maintain that 650 I got my money‚Äôs worth already. 

I‚Äôm in the middle of an It Takes Two playthrough with the wife and it‚Äôs a great time. Elden Ring blew my freaking mind, and it was fun being part of the online communities in that zeitgeist. It‚Äôs a good time to be a gamer, with whats come out recently and whats in the pipeline. 

But its also been a bit lame and lonesome. All my friends want a PS5 but they have given up over a year ago on going above and beyond to find one. And to be fair, its fucking ridiculous. And paying above MSRP is also a nonstarter for everyone I know. I am effectively the ONLY person I know IRL that has a PS5. Everyone else has moved on to Xbox which is actually attainable or even quit console gaming for PC gaming or other hobbies entirely. Other friends arent excited to play lesser versions of new games on old hardware so they forego new titles to hopefully experience them when they can get a newer console. 

I don‚Äôt really care about what the caused the supply shortage, be it covid, scalpers, chips, poor planning. But its been a strange year. It‚Äôs both the best time and a very disconnected time to be a gamer for IRL gaming friendships and interactions Ive had for the past 3 decades. 

TL;DR Love my PS5 and the new gen, just wish I could share that excitement with friends and family who have been left behind. Cheers.",,1651643002

And vizio was good but there's alot of software issues But the lg oled c1, man oh man the colors are just spot on and the level of details the tv brings out compared to the rest is a massive improvement. I didn't really think it could be that much of a difference in color or detail switching from the vizio oled to the lg c1 but boy was I wrong. You can tell the difference in quality immediately and all the latest gaming features seem to work on this tv for me at least. But I just wanted to say if anyone is looking for a gaming tv just save up and get you an lg oled. The prices for them these days have been to bad.

The 25 feet hdmi cable is no longer working with anything.

I used an short but old hdmi cable on my PS5 and PC and its working so I'm sure it's the 25 feet hdmi cable that broke.

PS5,uh4ki7,So should I just give up and go back to Xbox?,"Hey there, I'm new to the PS community. Really I'm not a part of it, but I was hoping to be. I have never owned a Playstation except the original console way back when. I became a fan of Xbox when it first came out because of titles like Halo and KoToR, games that were exclusive to Xbox at the time and then just kinda stayed with Xbox over the years. However, these days, I find myself playing a lot more titles that have online multiplayer elements where community size matters. And I had no idea that the PS community was 3 times the size of the Xbox. Especially with FromSoftWare titles, two of which, Demon Souls and BloodBorne that I never even got to experience. And damn I wanna own Elden Ring for PS5 over Xbox Series X. What I'm saying is I made the decision I wanna change sides, but is it worth the trouble?

Thing is, I simply can't find a PS5 from a non scumbag source. And I've been told that the PS5 will most likely not become widely available, as in being able to walk into a Best Buy without fear of being sold out, until mid 2023. I was actually told that back in February of 2021 by two different people, which I laughed off at the time, obviously I no longer think its funny. Now I just recently purchased a decent gaming PC, which was a bit pricey. I could maybe afford to buy an Xbox Series X (they are easily available to me), to hold me over awhile longer until the PS5 is more available, but what I cannot do, is afford to then rebuy all the games I purchased for the Xbox, again on the PS5, know what I'm saying? With prices on everything going up like crazy I'm trying to be very careful right now.

So I know I'm kinda talking to myself here and maybe this was a pointless post but I was wondering if anyone was in a similar boat in this logic; is it really worth waiting for the PS5 if it's going to take another year to get here? Like at that time, the system will be going on 3 years dated, when I could buy a Series X tonight, keeping all my microsoft purchase library for all the many titles I have already bought that I never played, which are in the dozens, and just say screw PS, or do you, the members of the PlayStation community think it's truly worth the wait? 

Guys I'm sorry if this comes off as a stupid question that I have already answered myself, that was not worth taking the time to read, I'm just having a hard time right now personally, every little thing is getting to me. I feel obsessed over which console to get, and video games right now are the only thing that takes my mind off of some really heavy shit I'm going through. Is it worth waiting or should I just stay with Xbox and wait for the PS6 instead? Thank you all.",,1651540050

So I love how the PS5 turns on the TV and Receiver when I turn on the PS button on the dual sense controller.

I was really interested in Remote Play from my iPad Pro.  I installed Remote Play, bought an extra dual sense that is only linked to the iPad.

When I link the ipad Pro to the PS5 with remote play, the PS5 goes from rest to on mode.  I understand that this is normal.  What I don't like is that the HDMI link activates the TV and receiver.

Is there a way to have HDMI link turn the TV and Receiver only when using normal play? (So that using Remote Play does not turn on the TV and Receiver?)

I have been trying to buy a PS5 since launch.. It was so difficult that I gave up for a while, but after hearing success stories, I registered to buy one. Last month I got an invite and managed to make it all the way to the checkout page. I thought this was it.. But to my surprise, no matter what I did, it wouldn't let me checkout (not a stock issue, but rather a payment issue..read more in my previous post)

I contacted SONY, they looked into it and a few days later they sent me an exclusive invite to buy a PS5 on Wednesday between 3-8PM. I made sure everything was in order and even asked 2 good friends to stand by with their credit cards as backup. I got to the checkout again and received the same error. I thought no worries, I have friends helping me. So I asked friend #1 to use his credit card. We tried it 2 times and both times it placed a hold on his funds but no checkout. I then called friend #2. We did same thing, again payment error. I stopped and figured we tried too many times. 3 days later I tried again with another card to buy another item from the store and again payment was declined. I contacted SONY, they looked into it and again invited me to buy a PS5 on Wednesday. But no matter what I do. No matter who I contact. No one seems to be able to fix this issue. I have read that more people have similar issues and I think its just unfair to loyal customers.

PS5,ugizlp,"Upgrading your existing PS4 library to PS5 is a nightmare, and I really wish I was warned about it beforehand.","So I finally got my PS5 today along with a 2TB M.2 drive, and I couldn't be less satisfied with my purchase. And it all comes down to the absolute nightmare that is upgrading your PS4 games to PS5 versions, as well as continuing your saves on the performance enhanced PS5 versions of these games I was previously playing on PS4. 

Here are all the different variations I've ran into so far when it came to trying to boot my old PS4 saves on the PS5 versions of applications. 

1. (Paying more than the base cost of the PS5 game. Eg.: FFVIIR) - The upgrade to the base game is free, but you have to buy the content that comes with the PS5 version separately. And it's twenty dollars, which means you pay $80 for a $70 game if you bought it on PS4 originally

2. (Have to download both PS4 and PS5 app. Eg.:FFXIV, FFVIIR, Spider-Man) - You have to download both the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game to your PS5 to transfer your save/settings over. Even though I transferred the save data over directly from my PS4 to my PS5 using the Data Transfer feature, I still have to manually boot the PS4 version of the above games to convert the PS4 save data into PS5 data. For certain games, PS4 save data can only be converted to PS5 save data WITHIN the PS4 version of the app. Meaning you have to download the same 80GB~ game twice just to be able to continue the save on the PS5. 

3. (Trophy Progress does not transfer even though your save does. Eg.: Elden Ring and GT7) - Game save will automatically convert which is great, but trophy progress between the PS4 and PS5 version isn't synced. If I play the PS4 version of Elden Ring on PS5, my trophies carry over. But if I continue my PS4 save on PS5, none of my trophies carry over. Which means I won't be able to get a platinum unless I kill all those bosses I got trophies for in a new game or New Game+. Haven't yet looked to see if any trophies I previously received in GT7 are now locked out due to my Dave's progress)

4. (Spider-Man. Just... Spider-Man) - This one is NUTS. And I haven't completely figured it out yet. But I can't upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from in the PS4 version of the app. And there's no purchasable upgrade within the PlayStation store. Apparently you need to buy Mile Morales Ultimate Edition to get the upgrade. And then you upgrade the PS4 version of Spider-Man to the PS5 version from the MILES MORALES APPLICATION. Wut???

5. Cyberpunk 2077 - Haven't finished downloading the app yet, but apparently you literally need to do nothing. Just download the PS5 version and your PS4 save is there. Trophy list carries over too from what I've seen. Completely baffled as to why this game with one of the shoddiest launches ever seems to have their version upgrade process down pat. 

So every game seems to work differently, and there's no guidance on any of it at all. You just boot a game and find out if you're lucky. And if you're not, it's to Google you go to see how/if you can bring you PS4 saves/trophies to the PS5 version of the game.

This to me is beyond unacceptable. I've been hearing about Xbox's smart delivery and how you just boot the game you want up and you saves are there and everything is optimized as needed and the buyers remorse I currently have is huge. I bought a PS5 for FFXVI/FFVIIR and because I had this massive digital library on my PlayStation 4 I wanted to hold onto, and right now I feel like I've been‚Äìdue to those two things‚Äìforced onto a platform I really want nothing to do with. 

Anyway, I know this is very ranty for an r/games post. But I think these examples are very important for potential buyers to be aware of, and I know if I saw a post like this, I would have held off on upgrading to the PS5. So hoping this stays up for others to see.",,1651471549

However, lately I've been having the itch to play newer games. I wanted to wait till Horizon: FW got a price drop but was anxious to play it and thought ""do I want to wait 6 months to save ‚Ç¨20"" and just bought it for ‚Ç¨80 (here in Germany). Then I looked and found that you can buy it on disc for as little ‚Ç¨35.

I think the digital PS5 would be fine for people who don't need the newest titles, or just have a shit load of money to burn. But having the games on disc means I can get newer titles much cheaper and can sell them afterwards if you don't plan on replaying them anytime soon. Hell, even if you want to replay something a few years later they'll be super cheap.

Does anyone else have regrets? Has anyone else sold their digital PS5 to buy the disc one?",,1651392678

One day for no reason when I ejected my game the disc itself comes all the way out, instead of mostly out so you can take the disc. I have to literally press eject and then hold my hands under the disc slot to catch the disc as it comes all the way out and falls into my hands.
Then the system continues to try and eject nothing at this point while making very loud ejection sounds. It does this cycle 4 times and then it's done. At this point I can not insert another disc. If I try it does nothing.
I learned if I press eject,  catch the disc, then lightly tap on the side of my PS5 disc drive ( maybe 5 to 10 light taps) it will stop its ejection thing its doing right away. Instead of its cycle of 4. As I am tapping on its side I listen for a light click sound. When I hear that it will allow me to insert another disc and play like normal.
This is a process I have to repeat everytime I want to play a different game.
Any help or ideas?
I have not taken the system apart yet. Hoping it's a simple fix if I do.
Sony was supposed to send me a box to it in for repairs at 14 months ( thank you to Reddit for saying Sony was still accepting warranty repairs after a year) but it didn't show up and when I got in touch again Sony wanted money.

But since it's the first model, I think it may have some issues and Id like some opinions on how to maintain it good.

I've noticed a bug? When I put it in rest mode sometimes it goes green screen. And when I leave it in rest mode for a while it needs to repair the console.

PS5,uebf8w,Turn off Activity Cards,"I've found a Frankenstein approach to turn off the Activity Cards. If you do the following, it should remove the cards and stop them from appearing as far as I can tell:

Under Settings:
- Notifications &gt; Games That Notify You &gt; manually unfollow each game
- Captures and Broadcasts &gt; Auto-Captures &gt; Trophies/Challenges &gt; select none or turn off Auto-Capture feature for both trophies and challenges

On the cards itself:
- Pro Tip Card &gt; Select 'Options' and select dismiss
- Any existing Trophy/Challenge cards &gt; select to open all captures and delete them

Now, this approach will mean no new videos of trophies or challenges are collected and your old ones are deleted, but you won't see any cards - so if your goal is no activity cards at all, this should do it. I called PS to confirm this would be a good approach and they actually took down MY notes to help other players in the future.

PS5,ue3vjj,Likelihood of Freesync support being added?,"It's my current understanding that only 13 monitors on the market currently support PS5 VRR. This is absolutely ridiculous: the cheapest monitors on the list all cost more than the PS5 itself. Why should I spend 600+ on a new monitor when my $200 monitor is completely capable of Freesync and the PS5 has an AMD chipset?

I'm legitimately considering getting the cheapest m32u as soon as i can afford it, but when that's more expensive than  a new XSX (which does support Freesync), why would I get a marginal upgrade to my display when I just get a more fully featured console that uses my current display better?


All that being said, it seems not only anticonsumer, but actually kinda stupid of Sony to not enable Freesync. I was not seriously considering an XSX before this half-baked VRR update, but now Sony has given MS a great advertisement. Of the more advanced users that care about VRR, how many of them are gonna shell out 600+ for the new display instead of just a new console for less? And this is all assuming that these monitors don't start getting scalped. There is very little selection and supply of these PS5 vrr compatible monitors, and since almost anything related to the PS5 gets scalped at some point, I would not be surprised to see cheaper units like the M28U, M32U, and the XB283K start selling out.

All of this being said, I think there is at least a chance that Sony eventually adds Freesync support. It doesn't seem likely (one would hope they would have realized how few monitors are supported and just included Freesync in the latest update, if not earlier in the consoles life cycle), but considering how this just suggests to customers to get an Xbox instead of a new display, I would hope that Sony reconsiders. What do yall think?",,1651176262

PS5,udyvjh,Upgrade Doom Eternal dlc.,"Hey! So I originally bought Doom Eternal on my Ps4, only the base game. Now I have gotten the Ps5 upgrade and finished the main game. I want to download the dlc' s Forgotten Gods 1 &amp; 2. However when I try to download it on my Ps5 it says "" Forgotten Gods part 1 required"". This leads me to believe I need to buy it for my Ps4 and then upgrade it for the Ps5 in order to make it work. 

Nu question is, will it work this way?",,1651163014

PS5,udpn0f,Dualsense touchpad issues,"I can't seem to find any clear info on this issue, especially on how to resolve it, so if anyone has seen another post about this please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to give a detailed explanation of the problem:

Whenever I've used the touchpad button input a few times the motion controls and touch input seem to malfunction. 

**General ps5 interface;** When typing something the cursor gets stuck when in the motion control mode of the keyboard. 

**Game examples;** In Ghostwire Tokyo you can used swiping on the touchpad to switch between 'weapons' and in other instances in the game you need to paint a symbol by swiping on the touchpad, but after having used the button of the touchpad this starts to act erratically. 

Another good example is GTA online, you have to hold the touchpad button to open the frequently used quick menu, but this messes with the weapon wheel or radio wheel to the point where even the stick input doesn't work to switch weapons or radio stations. It also messes with the ingame webbrowser used to access a multitude of services, the cursor keeps popping back into the upper left corner when you try to move it with the touchpad or stick.

&amp;#x200B;

**Temporary fix;** When I restart the controller it seems to fix the problem until I start pressing the touchpad button again. I've also tried compleatly resetting the controler but it just gives the same result.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to exchange my controller once before because a spring broke in one of the triggers, but both controllers have had this same issue. I've only recently started playing games that make more use of the touchpad and it's really quite annoying, especially in GTA Online (just tried to get back into that game and there are other reasons that reminded me why I quit in the first place, but having to turn my controller off and on again so often does not help either).

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows how to fix this more permanently or if it's just a bad controler and I need to go back to the store, please let me know.",,1651131605

I checked the system options and verified that the USB port alimentation on rest mode is on (is set to ""Always"") but nothing changed.
The system has the most recent update and the charge when the console is powered on (not in rest mode) gives no problems.
It's a common problem of the ps5 or I bought a faulty one?

I don't understand why they would hype this feature so much and nerf it. I suspect it's due to the fact Sony TVs don't support VRR lower than the 48hz range.

PS5,ucpxvn,PSA Regarding VRR and Fidelity Modes,"Unfortunately, It appears that the PS5 is limited to a 48-120hz VRR range even if your TV or monitor supports 20-120hz. This means that VRR is limited to frame rates of 48fps and higher. Fidelity Modes that cap frames at 30 or 40 frames per second will not benefit from VRR as it will not be engaged despite your TV telling you that it‚Äôs enabled.  

This can be shown by paying attention to the refresh rate on whatever info dialog your TV shows. When VRR is working between 48hz-120hz you will see the refresh rate fluctuating. When VRR disengages it will cap itself to the fresh rate of the panel (my C1 shows 119 when playing 30fps modes for example) and provide no benefit despite stating that it‚Äôs enabled. Reason being is the TV does technically recognize it as being enabled but if it falls out of it‚Äôs allowed range it disengages and waits for the frame rate to fall back in range so it can re-engage VRR.  

Not sure if it‚Äôs a hardware limitation or something that can be patched through firmware, but if you want to take advantage of VRR you‚Äôll need to be playing on the various performance modes that allow for 60+ frames. On the bright side uncapped performance modes are feeling great and people seem to be reported that games like Elden Rings performance mode feels much smoother.",,1651016300

5) Launch a game and once it has booted, press the green button on your TV remote a couple of times (press repeatedly) until a popup appears on your screen

6) In the Popup if it says ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù then your VRR is not on, if it says VRR and shows you the live fps, then VRR is working for you!

‚ÄúWhen the new PlayStation Plus membership plans launch, you will be able to upgrade to a plan with more features and benefits. When you upgrade you will be charged a pro-rated fee to level up the remaining time on your existing membership to the desired level.

PS5,ubn9bt,Games That Scratch the Detective Itch,"I'm not sure if I'm in the minority but I absolutely love these types of games. After just rewatching True Detective I really want to sit down and solve a murder and need some recommendations. On the PS5 the games are really few and far between but I know there has to be some hidden gems

L.A. Noire is the obvious choice but is pretty dated and at this point the facial animations just crack me up. I remember being obsessed with this game when it first came out and really wish Rockstar would dive into this genre again  


Disco Elysium is the one I've played most recently and damn is it good. I NEED more narrative games like this where your choices truly shape the story. One of those games where I wish I could wipe my memory and play again

Detroit: Become Human for certain sections is such an atmospheric detective game. Playing those sections as Connor at crime scenes was so good and makes me want Quantic Dream to develop a fully fledged detective game.   


Witcher 3's monster contracts honestly made you feel like Batman a bit - while there wasn't much choice in solving the mystery, following the clues and then consulting the bestiary once you had enough evidence to formulate your plan of attack was some fantastic detective gameplay.  


What other games am I missing? What is worth trying to scratch this itch? Thinking about possibly The Wolf Among Us before they release the new one. Is Sherlock Holmes Chapter 1 any good? The gameplay trailers I saw for it kind of turned me off. I recently tried Lost Judgement but the style was a bit too cheesy for me",,1650899208

PS5,ubj86d,Data not transferring to USB flash drive + software errors,"For a few days now, I haven't been able to transfer data correctly from my Media Gallery to a flash drive, and it looks like the console's USB ports may have something to do with it. Seeing that there have been lots of posts around here detailing issues with the USB ports, I was wondering if anyone had this same specific issue:  


\- When trying to transfer screenshots from the Media Gallery to an external flash drive, the transfer process gets stuck at 0% indefinitely, and I'm forced to cancel eventually.  
\- Bizarrely, even after canceling at 0%, a portion of the screenshots do get saved to the drive. Although it's always the same batch from the same game. The console acts as if I only screenshots from that particular game existed.

\- Even MORE bizarrely, the console still copies those same screenshots from that same particular game to the flash drive even after I DELETED them from the Media Gallery, while remaining stuck at 0% and forcing me to cancel the copying process as usual.

\- I normally use the front USB-C port, but the problem happens with all of them. In fact, the console doesn't even recognize the front USB-A port when I connect drives to it.

\- I've been in touch with customer support about this and they had me reinstall the latest software update, restore licenses, reset console options to default settings, delete cache and rebuild database. Nothing worked.

\- Each time I try to transfer data from the Media Gallery and this happens, the console also takes an unusual long time to power off. It stays well over ten minutes on the ""Preparing to turn off your PS5..."" screen. Next time I power it on, an error screen pops up requesting a report to Sony.  


I have nearly 500 screenshots saved in the console and there's no way to get them out of there like this. I could try to factory reset the console, but that would wipe them out. And based on everything I tried, I'm not even sure that'd solve anything either. Support insisted that it's probably a minor issue, and they said I could always wait for the next OS update, but even that I'm skeptical off considering reinstalling the last one didn't do anything. It feels like a more serious problem overall.",,1650887161

PS5,uaz5vu,My PS5 suddenly stopped detecting ANY of my controllers.,"Hi guys! I need help, like really.

Since the PS5 update from March 23rd, none of my 4 Dualsense controllers are detected by my console. 

I tried to connect them with USB, by Bluetooth, Resetting with the small button. (basically everything i saw on Youtube) Most of the tutorial i saw online are not related to my problem.

In fact, my Dualsense is actually recognized by my console, and sometimes i'm able to navigate for about 3 minutes before it shuts down and then starts charging. After that, it doesn't work anymore. I read online that maybe it was some kind of problem related to other Bluetooth devices in the environment, so i installed my PS5 in my bedroom instead of my gaming room and it doesn't change anything.

After that, i decided to completely reset my console with Safe Mode. Funny enough, when connecting my controllers by USB in Safe-Mode, it actually works perfectly (which is strange)

Nothing changed at all. 

Now i can't even get past the initial setup of the console since the controllers are disconnected after 3min.

One of the last thing that i remember doing before the update was connecting my Dualshock 4 to my PS5 to see if it works. It looks like it's related to the problem since i can't even connect my DS4 anymore. 

It's so strange because my PS5 was working perfectly. And my controllers are detected by my PC too so basically it's just my PS5 that doesn't to cooperate.

Anyone can help me? Thanks !",,1650819754

The PS5 controllers is the most shitty thing i've ever had so far. Not to mention how a brand new controller just died after just a first months. I still have PS4 controllers that are today over 5 years old, never any issues.

For many reasons i feel that the PS5 in general is a flop to me. Be it the terrible, overcomplicated, stupid UI, the controllers, the lack of the next-gen feeling (playing HZD 2 on Ultra HD top TV and can't see much of a difference), the haptic that to me is rather annoying than cool, as feels half a\*\*ed. Also individual background pictures look so bad, laughable resolution. As for changing it i start my PS4 for it, to then use on PS5, as the PS5 for whatever reason makes it look shitty. Advertisements and 2 task bars...-\_- No option to create folders. A simple thing like leave a chat turned into a bothersome task.

I was never ever a Xbox fan. To me no way. But still, can't say that i'm much pleased with the PS5 so far. That never happened on any PS i had before, as i did really enjoy all of them and always felt improvement on upgrading.

PS5,uaaqmz,PS5 WiFi 6 DHCP issues,"Hi all,

I just bought the PS5 and tried to join it to my wireless network.

My WiFi network is compromised of an Extreme Networks AP305C supporting WiFi6.

All devices work on this AP depending on their capabilities either natively to WiFi6 on both 2.4G and 5G. Other downgrade to 802.11G, 802.11N or 802.11AC depending on their radio.

&amp;#x200B;

The PS5 works without any issues when I explicitly configure my AP on the 802.11AC protocol.

The DHCP server works and internet connectivity is OK.

When I try to offer 802.11AX on the AP all devices work except the PS5 where for some reason it does not accept the DHCP offer from the DHCP server.

&amp;#x200B;

The AP has been moved to direct line of sigh and a few meters away from the PS5 in order to check the power.

When it first connects it states approximately 90% power.

&amp;#x200B;

Static IP address assignment does not work either which makes me think that their is a bug on the WiFi6 protocol support.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other users with the same experience or how their resolved it?",,1650735872

I transferred all my saves from ps4 to cloud storage (I'm a ps plus member), then set up my ps5 without transferring anything over from ps4.  The goal was to download my saves from the cloud and start fresh as I had a lot of unplayed games on my ps4.

So, set up the ps5. Went into saved data management - &gt; ps5 - &gt; Cloud storage.  All my saves are viewable and total about 4.28gb, but... The download button is greyed out. When I click it I get an error noise.  This happens if I select all or select individual saves.

PS5,u9uc9b,I'm really tired of having to deal with the ps5's bullshit!,"      The ps5 is one of the most finicky devices I've ever owned. I'm so frustrated at it constantly, I feel like almost every other time I turn it on or boot up a game it throws an error at me. Most of the time it's a simple fix but it's so annoying. But the cherry on the sundae of shit just happened to me, I just had to factory reset my console (with no other options) just to get it to boot up. I don't pay for ps+ because I mostly only play single player games, but apparently it only cloud saves your data if you have it. 

      I've had my Xbox series X for about 6 more months than my ps5 and it is just works so much better. The thing that caused the need for a factory reset was a power outage during an update. They always say don't turn it off which I've tried to stick to but it happend anyway the  funny thing about that is same thing happened to my xbox series x and my xbox one x (maybe I should get my power checked out) but neither of them needed a factory reset it just started the download over. Also if it did factory reset on Xbox consoles you don't need xbox live to use cloud saves.

A full price game should be priced as such so that a developer/publisher can make the profits they think fair for their effort but to charge 70 quid AND have micro transactions AND have adverts is inexcusable. We have allowed publishers to get away with including MTX in full priced games (don't get me started, you know who you are) but we can't lose this fight. I understand if a game is F2P, in that case have at it, but if you pay the launch price for a game then they have no right to include MTX and advertising, I honestly would rather pay 80 quid for a game if that's what it takes to ensure the future of a good dev but I cannot stomach adverts in games, I just can't.

**Disclaimer**: This is the FIRST PS console I have ever owned!

I am not sure if this is expected from a PlayStation but I am slightly (negatively) surprised about the UI for the PS5. On a smaller scale, I expected the game icons to be bigger and detached from the PS Store and other icons.

But, on a larger scale, I expected the ""Close Game"" icon or the ""Turn Off PS5"" button to be visible without me clicking other buttons to get there.

Maybe it's just that I am not used to it and it's always been like this... Just wanted to know the opinions of those who are used to the PlayStation consoles.",,1650656164

The tracking just says label created so obviously they won't ship and I'm sure walmart isn't competent enough to let me update payment and will cancel it all because ABOA and Walmart are both full of idiots.

Then walmart support just says if it's canceled order it again. yeah because that is so easy to order a digital ps5. lol.

I grew a bit too old for online and heavy grindy and repetitive mmorpgs (yeah, I'm talking about World of Warcraft) so even though I do not have a preference for any genre, I do like games with complex stories and mechanics (huge FromSoftware fan, played DS1/DS2/DS3/Sekiro and currently messing around in Elden Ring). So, what should I play next?

&amp;#x200B;

My current list looks kinds like this:

* Demons Soul
* Heavy Rain
* Beyond Two Souls
* Until Dawn
* ASTRO's PLAYROOM
* TLOU 1 &amp; 2
* Detroit Become Human
* inFAMOUS Second Son
* Watch Dogs Legion
* AC: Valhalla
* Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves
* Persona 5

To get the updates installing again, I need to restart my PS5.  And yes, I have power being supplied to my USB ports constantly. 

But what I think the issue is, I went to play Fallout 76 and inserted the disc, but my PS5 froze, I could bring up thr quick menu, but I couldn't click off the game, so I restarted my PS5.  Then the update for Fallout 76 appeared in my downloads.  But when I restarted my PS5, it said the data on it is corrupted to reformat, but I'm able to play my games though.

PS5,u8yh6n,Controller Seating (Official DualSense Charging Station),"Does anyone else with the official Sony branded DualSense Charging Station find the bridge on which the actual controllers sit to be absurdly narrow? You have to perch it on this tiny strip of plastic and it takes a little bit of wiggling every time you set a controller down to get the spring to launch and the charging pins to make contact.

&amp;nbsp;

I have two charging stations and I got so frustrated with it that as an experiment I added little rubber risers to the top of one (little strips of rubber along side the two spots where the controllers cradle, stuck between the white and black plastic of the charging station.) End result: They act as gripping feet for the controller bottom and you can drop the controller down willy-nilly and it just lands right on the charging spot every time.

&amp;nbsp;

Which leads me to the question: Why did Sony design the thing to be so fiddly? Extending those white plastic flanges additional *millimeters* upwards would have made it so much more stable!",,1650577649

PS5,u8xni0,PS Direct Not Fulfilling Replacements,"TLDR: I sent my PS5 for exchange with PlayStation Direct after being told they had available replacements, but they‚Äôre now refusing to send the replacement due to a ‚Äútechnical issue‚Äù with their systems since March.

Be careful about doing exchanges with PS Direct. My WiFi would crash whenever connecting to a 5GHz WiFi network. After troubleshooting with PlayStation Support, I was offered warranty service but was told that I could end up with a refurbished unit. Keeping in mind that PS Support is separate from PS Direct where I bought my console, I figured it would be safer to go back to PS Direct and exchange for a new unit since it was within 30 days if they had any available.

I contacted PS Direct chat support, and my case was escalated for someone to call me about an exchange. We discussed at length that they had replacement inventory available, and I would receive my replacement within 10 business days, and so I agreed.

According to FedEx, PS Direct received my console on March 16. I had read about others receiving their replacements from PS Direct within just a few days, so I grew worried when the order status website hadn‚Äôt updated a week later. I spoke with PS Direct chat on March 23, but all they could say was to assure me that it would be sent out within 10 business days (with 5 more to go), that they saw my case was escalated, and that someone would reach out to me further.

No updates or contact a week later, so I reach out to PS Direct chat support on March 29. I am now told that the exchange policy is for 12 days instead of 10, and their website was updated to reflect that. They at least confirm receipt of my console according to their warehouse. I ask if the old 10 policy still applied to my replacement, and they agree to have a supervisor get back to me. (It seems the 12 days policy was temporary, as the website was updated again the next day back to 10 days.)
I follow up with PS Direct chat support again on March 31 and April 1, but nobody had any additional information. Later that day on April 1, I finally get a call from a PS Direct supervisor. I am told there is some problem with their system; they did receive my console; but it‚Äôs ‚Äústuck‚Äù in their system which prevents my replacement going out. I am offered a refund and told that I can try to purchase a new console in the next drop.

It's now April 21. I end up receiving only a partial refund and I still don‚Äôt have a PS5 console, and I'm stuck with a bunch of worthless games.",,1650575305

I read that you could make it faster with a lan cable connected to both the consoles but i connected them after i chose the Wifi option so i don't know if it works or if it just needs some time.

PS5,u8dca0,Sony should capitalize on native backwards compatibility. The PS5 is becoming boring.,"  

* The Playstation 2 was backwards compatible with the Playstation 1 OG. Initially, the Playstation 3 was backwards compatible with the PS2 and PS1.
* The Playstation 3 Slim and Super Slim were backwards compatible with the PS1.
* The PS4 had no backwards compatibility with previous consoles and struggled to emulate PS2 hardware such as games like the PS2-Classic: The Grand Theft Auto Trilogy. 
* The PS5 has backwards compatibility with the PS4, owing to the fact that the PS5 was built on the PS4 architecture, making them essentially the same. Needless to say, when I play a PS2-Classic title such as Bully on my PS5, it constantly freezes and stutters, much alike the PS4 version. 

Although each console's graphical developments are always next generation, their hardware capabilities post-PS3 era are going backwards at the same time as they are going forwards. After a few months of owning my PS5, I came to this conclusion. Whenever I felt the need to play games from previous generations, excluding the PS4, I had to tediously plug in either my PS3, PS2 or PS1. This, in turn, reduces the amount of time I can spend playing on my PS5. Since purchasing my Xbox Series X, I no longer need to plug in my previous generation Xbox consoles, unless I want to play something that is not on the backwards compatibility list, such as Two Worlds. I no longer have to worry about plugging and unplugging hardware, fumbling through AV cables/separate HDMIs, and finally deciding which game belongs to which generation in order to play. 

It would not be a waste of money to spend millions of dollars deciphering their own PS3 architectural language in order to get the games running natively on a PS5. What a waste of energy and money is Sony running hundreds, if not thousands of PS3s in a basement around the clock to be streamed by paying customers via PS Now, and eventually PS Plus Spartacus, despite the streaming service being nearly unusable for the majority of players due to technical issues/input lag/etc. Sony needs to up their game, and I say this as a die-hard Sony fan who has to resort to a 3rd-party such as Xbox in order to accomplish such things. I'm also willing to bet that no PS4 owner with no prior console experience has ever played Grand Theft Auto IV or Midnight Club LA. One might ask, ""What's the point of buying a new console if you're just going to play old games?"" The answer is to have more options for playing games; out with the old and in with the new applies to almost everything other than gaming. 

TL;DR All of this in a nutshell: sometimes, people, such as myself, get burnt out playing new games, and want to play titles of the past feasibly.",,1650509007

There is probably a bias there towards PS Plus members for Sony selecting you for a PS5 restock.  In the restock email, it said that you had to click the link at 2:00.  If you clicked the link before 2:00, it said that you would be blocked from the link.  I watched the clock and as soon as it turned to 2:00, I clicked the link only to find out that there was an hour long wait.  Are they allowing people in early?

After clicking on the link right at opening (did it right at :00:00) and then waiting in a 15-minute queue, they sold out within a minute of me entering my information. I understand that in these processes the receipt of an email, getting to the front of the queue, or apparently even having it in your cart is no guarantee to a console but this is getting ridiculous. The Playstation Direct stock drops should work in a way that, since they are already limiting it to one console per household, there are exactly as many units available as emails they send out. That way, the lottery system is effectively a reservation of a console. I understand that not every person who gets the email will participate in the drop so they open it up to more people than they have supply for but honestly underselling in each drop wouldn't be the worst thing. It would allow them to role supply over to the next drop, allowing for more frequent drops. It would also build more goodwill with the customer, which Sony is lacking on given the shitty release this console has had over the last two-three years. At the moment, and I have seen others on here who feel the same way, they have a customer who was excited to be given a chance only for the rug to be pulled out from underneath them when their hope was at its highest. Obviously, I am grateful to have had the opportunity but I am bordering on just giving up until the next iteration of this generation. The world is back open (at least from a Western/Northern perspective), there is no longer an argument for the inability to have units in the store like every other console release ever, similarly limited to one console per government ID or whatever other form of limiting.

I do not think my HDD is failing for the following reason.  


1. Currently own a PS4 Slim 1TB, bought it brand new in 2020.
2. Usage: solely gaming. For most of the period (2022 until now) since I have bought it, I seldom have time to play on it. If I do play, the usage time on average is 1-3 days per week, each time 2-3 hours. 
3. Storage usage: never used up more than 50% of maximum capacity.

This will last for a bit, and after about 5 or 6 months I haven't had to do it at all. Until two nights ago I had to do it twice in the week. Now today, after getting an error message for my ps5 over heating, I was going to rebuild the database from safe mode, but now for the life of me cannot get it to start in safe mode. It will make the second beep, change the light color from blue to white indicating that it is indeed in safe mode, but just like how my normal launch would be to a black screen, this is now only showing that black screen for safe mode. Even stranger, is that I am infact able to launch it normally all the same.

PS5,u7i3mi,PS5 success story.,"In idk about other states but in Utah there's a store called RcWilley. And they sell electronics. Today i decided to look on their site to see if they had stock but their site said ""out of stock"". On their site the PS5 digital version is listed for $469. I was confused about this as we all know the digital version is $399. So i decided to email the store and see why the price was higher than retail and if they would price match the retail price of the item since it was listed somewhere on their site. Within minutes i received a response. 
The agent explained that the price is that way because it's actually bundled with a controller. Hence the $69 dollar price hike. 
I said ok cool, now that makes sense. I proceeded to ask if they were getting any new stock soon and they responded that they usually get stock every 2-3 months. He added that he could add me to a wait-list if I wanted to. I gave him my information to be added to the wait-list and he responded that they actually had a digital version in stock if I wanted to purchase it. 
I was shocked! I was not expecting them to have stock since I was just looking for info. 
I told him yes I want the PS5 (obviously) and he then sent me an email confirming that the PS5 was on hold for me. I left work and headed straight to the warehouse and I got my PS5! 

I'm so glad I didn't give in to any scalpers and that my patience stayed with me along the way.

Currently playing ""The Last Of Us II"" on the PS5, using the disc / physical version. All our other games are digital, except SackBoy which our little girl plays. The way the PS5 is set up, swapping the discs between games is a bit tedious.

We scored some PSN card from a contest a while back, and see that Last of Us II is currently on sale. 

If we buy the 'digital' version on the Playstation Store to avoid needing the disc, do we basically just uninstall the current one and then download + re-install using the digital one for it to no longer ask to insert the disc?

I own a ps5 digital only. I started to play fifa 22 and nba 2k. Problem is I get tired of them so I delete them. But I still want to play them and redownload them and get sick of them again and delete them again to make space for other games. 
I must have done this like 20 times for fifa and 10 times for nba.

PS5,u7e2e3,Overheard some resellers talking‚Ä¶,"Was at a thrift store and there were a couple resellers that beat me to the video games, they just had them all stacked in front of them and were scanning through them with Amazon app. Ugh I hate seeing this but it what it is. They were talking loudly though and bragging about how many PlayStation 5 consoles they had. One claimed to have 5 consoles and the other had 4. 

I already have a PlayStation 5, so I am not worried, but still frustrating to hear this. They were talking about they were hold long term until the prices are at peak. 

My opinion on this is that prices have since peaked, and I for one would refuse to buy from a reseller out of principle. Hearing them brag like this just makes me hope they get stuck with the consoles lol. Yea maybe a bit immature on my part, but I just want customers that actually want the console to have them, not resellers. What do you guys think?",,1650398481
PS5,u7du89,Playstation Account wrongfully suspended,"So basically, I redownloaded LBP3 on my playstation because I was really bored. I went and tried to find worlds that would offer free items from the story since I didn't really wanna complete it. I found some but there was one specific world that was so messed up. It was basically a troll and wasn't giving anything. It was literally costumes of sackboys in KKK costumes that were surrounding what I can assume a black person on an upside down cross on fire. Now what I would assume a right minded person would do was to report it, which I did. I literally went to the good grief option then selected report and wrote that this was literally a KKK rally and I didn't expect that I needed to explain that much as the screenshot that was required to be posted was self explanatory.

Later after 5 minutes to my surprise I see a notification that I breached playstations code of conduct. I check my phone and I get an email that I am banned from using playstation services for 7 days due to hateful content.

I tried contacting playstation live chat and they said they cannot help me and I'd just have to wait out the days I'm suspended for. I tried calling live support and they wouldn't help at all and whoever I spoke to they would say the same thing ""that the safety moderation team takes investigations very seriously and their decision is final"" and they have it in their system that I got reported for hate speech even though it was technically ME who reported a game level and got myself banned. Is it cause in the report description I said ""it's literally a KKK rally?"" with a screenshot attached??? You cannot tell me a human being went and saw my report and made that decision. It had to be a bot and they do not want to admit that because no sane person would go through and suspend me for what happened.

And now I'm going to be stuck being paranoid not knowing what will happen if I get suspended again for doing nothing and not knowing how severe they can make it. There is nothing I can do about it nor anyone I can talk to that can actually help me. I guess whenever I see anything that's fucked up I'll leave it be because in the end I'm going to get punished.",,1650397890

PS5,u7dhdi,definitely give Cyberpunk 2077 a try on PS5,"This game is definitely playable with the current patch (1.52), I really enjoyed it unfortunately I can't share any screenshot in here but CD Projekt put a lot details in the game world in the story and characters. The story has deep roots, the characters are unique the game play is flexible it can be done  both stealthy or all out combat, the gun play is awesome so as melee or using Katana they all feel unique and special. The visual and details are stunning on PS5. I can describe every aspect of the game but that be spoiling so much of it. Self discovery is definitely worth it for something like this. but the world of Cyberpunk is definitely worth discovering the lore and culture its very interesting. I personally enjoyed playing this game I have over 167 hours of game play, and during this time I have encountered few visual bugs but nothing that prevented me from playing the the game, I had very few game crashes in patch (1.5) but since patch 1.52 that happens very rarely.

PS5,u75pai,Sackboy is a better Mario 3D World,"There. I said it, I know I‚Äôm gonna piss off someone for saying that but in my opinion, Sackboy takes inspiration from Mario 3D Worlds but actually improves it and does its own things enough to make it stand and here is why:

- Levels in 3D World are fun but really forgettable, short, and most not having unique visuals. I barely remember a few if I have to be honest with you. 
Sackboy on the other hand, I think I remember almost every single level I have played. They are all very memorable, beautiful art direction, right amount of length, and still fun to go through. Especially music style levels. 

- Co-op in my opinion feels a lot more thought-out in Sackboy than Mario 3D World. For starters, it still has chaotic elements but encourages team work through gameplay a lot more, especially at few levels that require another person. Also, we didn‚Äôt had to wait until the switch for online co-op in Mario 3D World. Sackboy had that shit at launch.

- Lastly, side stuff in Sackboy feel actually rewarding and get challenging but still keeping the core fun platforming and reward you with post game world. What does 3D World do? Having to require to 100% the game each as the four playable characters and having to do through slow ass captain toad stages that made me fall asleep. Yeah, thats why I never bothered to 100% 3D World.

If you like 3D World more, I respect your opinion but please. Stop calling Sackboy a ripoff of that game.",,1650376422

It is my first gaming system ever (I'm in my late 30s), and I haven't found a game that I jive with that lets me relax, unwind, and just have fun. Ultimately, I'm looking to sell my system for what I bought it for, but don't know if that is possible (have the supply issues been resolved?)

The system is the version with a disc drive and it has about 100 hrs of playtime on it. Would it be possible to get my $650 back for the system, 2 controllers, and charger (I will only sell it as a set)? Are there any scams I need to be wary about? How do I erase my data from the machine? I plan on putting a CL ad to sell it, so I guess someone would need to come into my house unless someone else has an idea of how to sell it while avoiding that. I'm hoping to sell it to someone in their 30s/40s looking to escape life.",,1650319214

PS5,u6o6et,Playing PS5 remote on Samsung s7 plus tablet,"I only recently learned that Sony allows remote play on the PS5. I downloaded the app to my tablet only to find the dual sense control(which works fine in android itself) doesn't work in the PS remote app. I chose the easy route to get around this and used my PS4 dual shock, but it appears to have a bad battery or something, keeps dying, so I was back to finding a way to get the dualsense to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually saw an article that said they fixed the issue in May 2021, but that doesn't seem to be the case for every device. The dual sense works fine with PS remote on my pixel 3, but not trying to play on that small of a screen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are some other apps aside from Sonys official one so I bought PSPlay and tried it, the dual sense still doesn't work wirelessly on the s7 plus, but does work wired, which i can tolerate but is not preferred. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I am missing as to why it works wireless on one device but not another with the same version of android(well Samsung has OneUI, but I meant both Android 12). 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I stick to playing wired on PSPlay, or is there another app I could try?",,1650317683

So, I‚Äôve ran into a bit of a problem, with some games being restricted on my PS5, with no option to request access to the ‚Äòrestricted‚Äô games that I try to play. 

I‚Äôve tried following advice in a few threads, but have encountered problems because A) my account gives me no control or ability to turn off parental controls (when I click a profile, it just gives me a basic rundown of username and email address - utterly useless) and B) my ‚Äòparental settings‚Äô are tethered to the age of my PSN account, so I can‚Äôt change it that way either.

It took AGES for me to get used to the PS button compared to how it worked on the PS4 so I wish that just worked in a similar way but I'd say ny biggest gripe would be how party chat works with the controller. Lemme explain...

When you enter a party chat you can use the PS5's built in mic. Not the greatest mic in the world but it does the job, wonderful. However, the party chat audio comes out of controller as well and it is QUIET! You can barely hear ehat your friends are saying no matter how loud you crank all settings up and you'll most likely need to turn your TV down to hear anything. However, there's no option to get the party chat audio to come through the TV screen while you're using your controller's mic as an option, which forces me to use headphones. I've had to grow accustomed to using the headphones but before I was very pleased with using the PS4 camera as my mic in party chats and just have the TV as the speakers. No need for headphones, it was a glorious age...

One last pet peeve would be the HD Camera. I kinda get why it doesn't have a built in mic but yo...gimme a mic dammit ü§£",,1650265473

It had no issues when I turned it on while I'm logged in on the console, but restarting my TV or PS either makes the screen flicker (in black) or I get a ""No Signal"" error.

I've tried 3 different HDMI cables, including a 2.1. As per a few suggestions found around the internet, I've tried switching off the HDCP, tried -1 &amp; -2 transfer rate, turned off Overscan on my TV Picture setting, but to no avail.

Confused if it's a hardware problem or something to do with an option in the TV or the PS. Everything runs smooth with the HDR turned off, or if I turn it on after the PS is turned on without it. I've played 7-8 hrs of game with HDR on but the moment I restart either of the devices it goes back to this flickering freak show.",,1650264678

Some might ask ""Well who cares? You already have the game through PS+ then so just install that"". Well, yes, but let me make a couple of points on why that isn't ideal:

First and foremost, we don't ""own"" PlayStation Plus titles. These are temporary licenses that expire once your PlayStation Plus expires. If I've purchased a PS4 game that is meant to give me access to a full, permanent license to a PS5 game, I'd like to be able to redeem that whether I have the PS+ license or not. Instead, I'm stuck with the temporary license.

Second, when you put a PS4 disc into your system, it checks to see if there's a PS5 upgrade available. If there is, the disc won't install immediately. This gives you the ability to choose which version you'd like to install first and is great for saving space. I say this because when the PS5 first released, if you placed a PS4 title into the system that had a PS4 upgrade, it would install the PS4 game regardless and basically take up double the space. This was later patched to give you the option before anything installed. If you've redeemed the PS5 version through PS+ however, it skips this check, and immediately starts installing the PS4 version off the disc as soon as it's placed in the system - exactly how it worked before it was patched.

I have looked online to see if there's a way around this issue. Someone suggested deleting all versions of the game, then hiding the PS+ version from your library. Apparently this would allow you to grab the PS5 upgrade from the store, but it seems this method no longer works. Some people have also tried contacting PlayStation Support to get their PS+ license removed, which they've been told can't be done.

Now, to be fair, I have no idea if when my PS+ runs out everything will revert back to how it should be and I'll be able to grab my free upgrade. But I really shouldn't have to wait that long for a feature that's advertised on the box.",,1650258915

PS5,u5ykgn,anyone kno why my PS5 controller isnt working?,"ok here's the story...

 i'm on pc, not console. until recently i havent held a console controller in my hands since sega dreamcast was the newest thing out. anyways, i recently wanted to buy a game i have to have a controller for so i ordered a PS5 controller from amazon. while waiting for it to arrive my roommate let me borrow his old PS4 controller.  he installed something on my pc for it to recognize it as a PS controller instead of Xbox. the PS4 controller worked fine.  the PS5 controller arrived and it worked fine too but then i stopped using it right away bc i didnt feel like configuring all my buttons again and got bored of that game anyways so i put the controller away for a week... then i decided to get back on that game and the controller wouldnt work... the border around the touchpad would flash blue for a second then turn off... i restarted my pc and it worked fine again. then i stopped playing that game again for good and put the controller away again for like 6 weeks.

so i bought another game that needs a controller and the controller wasnt working again... i figured it was sitting in a box for 6 weeks maybe it just needed to be charged so i left it plugged in all night but it still wouldnt turn on, it would just have the flashing blue lights around the touchpad then turn off... then i remembered how before restarting my pc fixed it so i restarted my pc and it worked just fine again but then the very next time i unplugged it it wont turn on again no matter wat i do but my roommate's PS4 controller still works fine.

any ideas?",,1650236440
PS5,u5y7jw,What 2-3 specific recent gaming experiences have made you felt EXCEPTIONALLY HAPPY to be a PS5 owner?," For me, it's been

1) Playing Elden Ring PS4 version and experiencing that game at a perfect 60 fps which PCs can't even do atm üòÇüòÇüòÇü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ it literally never deviates from 60 fps (I'm level 300 slowly playing through the game cuz that's how I do it, max out my favorite stats in the first 3rd of action RPGs üòÜüòÜüòÜ)

2) Playing the PS5 next gen patch for GTA V Online and experiencing almost perfectly consistent 60 fps using the ""performance with ray-tracing"" graphics mode while experiencing very immersive haptic feedback on the Dualsense. Gunplay feels real with trigger resistance that actually does it's job. Driving is a joy and feels and looks great 1st person on a motorcycle feels NICE. 

And music vibrates the controller so you feel like you're ACTUALLY in a club, car, etc. It's pretty next level and shockingly well done! They really invested in Dualsense optimization (LOOKING AT YOU ELDEN RINGüòíüòíüòíüòí).

3) Fortnite on PS5 is ridiculously smooth and fast loading and this season has no building and added sprinting so it's just fast gun play and running around, I am a poor man but playing this game on PS5 makes me feel like I am rich if that makes sense üòâüëçüôè just wanted to share, thanks!",,1650235380

PS5,u5utnb,I just beat Ghostwire: Tokyo yesterday after 30ish hours. Here‚Äôs my honest review,"I had my eye on this game ever since it was announced. The aesthetics immediately grabbed my attention, and the game director at the time of the Bethesda E3 was both charming and passionate. The game quickly joined my other list of potential buys, and I kept it on my radar over the months

Some troubling developments made me concerned: the director left, the game seemed to shift from horror to action, etc. but the biggest thing working against it was it‚Äôs release window. Coming out so soon after some gargantuan releases like Horizon Forbidden West and Elden Ring meant there was very little chance it was a day one purchase anymore. My game of choice was Elden Ring, and after 300 hours across 3 playthrough and a platinum later,  I found myself in that dreaded, nebulous mindstate most of us fall into

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù

I tried playing through Kirby, Control, and Alan Wake. I felt like I was on the right track, but something still wasn‚Äôt clicking. Then I took a crack at Ghostwire, and here we are again wondering what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôm pretty sure the gameplay gave me the shooter itch so I‚Äôm going to replay Doom Eternal on PS5 this time so I can get into the DLC naturally since I beat the game before any had dropped. But before I do, I wanted to take some time to write out my thoughts on this probably hidden gem of 2022. I know, I know, it just came out a month ago. But something tells me this might not have done as well as Tango or its fans would want, so here‚Äôs hoping it does well on Xbox so a sequel can still happen

I think my biggest gripes with the game are the lackluster New Game+ and nitpicks with combat and traversal. Since there aren‚Äôt a whole lot of negatives, let‚Äôs get those out of the way

#NEGATIVES

New Game+ does not inspire one to complete the game for a casual fan. Because basically nothing important carries over, I did not feel incentivized to collect every lost spirit, hidden tanuki, or artifact for cats. Which is a shame because this is a game that would excel at power fantasy on subsequent playthroughs. So as much as I enjoyed my time the first go around, I had no qualms jumping ship once the main mission and side missions were complete. I didn‚Äôt mind the mostly empty world since it fit the aesthetic and story, and there are enough enemies and activities to occupy you running, flying, and‚Ä¶crouching through Tokyo?

This is my next negative: the combat and traversal need some work. There‚Äôs just no getting around that, as much love as you‚Äôre going to see in a sec‚Ä¶there are some minor and major gripes here. First off, there is zero reason for there to be a crouch button if you‚Äôre not going to have a slide mechanic. You have vaulting, you have jumping, and yet I still feel like I‚Äôm playing a shooter from the early 2000s. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that since the combat was worked on by someone who worked on Doom 2016 and that game had heavy inspiration from its own history‚Ä¶but considering you have spirit powers and can glide, you‚Äôd think KK would let Akito dodge on the ground and in the air. So here‚Äôs my compromise: have parts of the game where crouching is needed use a context specific button prompt, or remove crouching sections entirely. Regardless of the decision here, the crouch button should now be a dodge. If you want to make it a slide when you‚Äôre running, fine‚Ä¶but the guard/parry are not enough defensive options, and crouch is frankly useless. As is melee combat and the bow

The least fun thing any game can do is take away the power fantasy. It‚Äôs not just a speed bump, it‚Äôs an absolute momentum killer. People who played Spider-Man know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about with MJ or Miles Morales missions. The parts of the game where KK is removed from Akito, even enemy attacks, SUCK. The bow feels horribly underpowered, undercooked, and like an afterthought. Unless you use prayer beads and (IMO) waste skill points on the bow‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just not fun at all. I didn‚Äôt sign up for discount Far Cry, I wanted to be Japanese Doctor Strange! For fuck‚Äôs sake, the biggest draw for me is the fact that it‚Äôs a First Person Shooter without traditional shooting mechanics! Which brings me to melee‚Ä¶why? Just why? You have this guy harnessing the power of the literal elements and his melee is a baby slap? Make him weave with melee! Supercharge his fists or something with rocks! Anything would be better, even a katana or SOMETHING to make it feel weighty when you have a chance to sneak a melee hit for SP regain

Okay‚Ä¶I think that‚Äôs the negative. I actually mostly have positives for the game

#POSITIVES

For starters, I think the story is serviceable. I grew to care about the leads, even if it falls under the trap of ‚Äúthe main missions seems really pressing, but I‚Äôm gonna not do that for dozens of hours‚Äù trope open world games fall into. While I did not care much for the villain, this could be fixed with him having a more taunting relationship with the leads through his ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù. I enjoyed the world and aesthetics, and if anything am grateful such an excellent modern depiction of Tokyo is now playable. The enemy variety is decent, but the AI could be more aggressive so long as my suggestions for combat and traversal are implemented to make it ‚Äúfair‚Äù

I love love love the talismans but think the button placement is wonky. I‚Äôm not crazy about putting it where the bow is on the touchpad (swipe left) or down on the d-pad, but it definitely can‚Äôt stay where it is as is. I also found that once I got used to using the touchpad for changing spells I NEVER used R1 to change spells again. So here‚Äôs my thought: since it is essentially a ‚Äúgrenade‚Äù, put it on R1 and make that the only radial menu if you hold it to change the type. Since Xbox won‚Äôt have a touchpad, make all spell swaps on the D-pad regardless of console. If the bow is removed per my negatives on it above, you could have a different element on the left

#CONCLUSION

I realize none of these changes can be implemented for the game in a patch or even DLC. These are more like my suggestions for a sequel. I think after some reflection, I would grade Ghostwire: Tokyo at a 7.5 / 10, maybe 8 / 10 on a good day. I think with some more time in the oven (and less of an identity crisis), the sequel could be 9 or 10 out of 10. Very fun game, and when the combat clicks and you‚Äôre in a groove switching between spells it‚Äôs addicting tbh

P.S.: Overhaul the sensitivity settings. Just start from scratch. Even with MAJOR tweaking, I was never in love with the camera. When I booted up Doom Eternal, it was perfect right out the gate. Granted, Id are the GOATS of FPS, but still",,1650225361

PS5,u5oyky,An Important Message For You Who‚Äôs PS5 Still Turns Off On Its Own - Why This Happens &amp; How To Truly Fix It.,"A brief recap on my personal experience with this issue. Skip paragraphs if you don‚Äôt want be bothered with my story.

My PS5 was turning itself off on its own while playing PS5 games (even PS4 update versions), several times a day. I cleaned it the best I could, following dozen of guides and advice everywhere I could find for this to no avail. I did ALL the TS steps from PlayStation support twice, I changed plugs, tried plugging it directly to the wall plug, you name it, but the issue persisted. I tried the vents for cooling and absolutely nothing was working. For months and months this was my reality.

One day, I was talking to a friend who I did not see for a long time. He fixes boat motors now and other sailing ship stuff and we ended up discussing motors and vents and from there I gave the PS4 and PS5 vents as an example for something I can‚Äôt recall. The discussion went to my current PS5 issue I had and he said to bring it in for him to check since I had nothing to lose.

I do it on the next day without expecting much. So I opened the PS5 for him and he said it looked very clean, and he saw the opening and overall venting system. He grabbed an air pressure gun, I mean a HUGE one used on boats, that shit was loud, and he adjusted the pressure. It was strong enough to push his hand slightly back when pressed against it.

I was very nervous but he started to explain that dust and cloth can diminish the full rotational potential of the fan and it could be why no matter how clean it was it would never stop telling the system to shut down. 
He went on and on about more technical stuff. I was afraid the potency of the air pressure would damage something inside but he told me it would be very unlikely so I trusted him.

So he started doing his thing and there was cloths of dust coming of from deep inside the PS5, nothing really surprising. Then he pointed the air pressure gun in an angle towards the vent and made it spin to max for around 10 secs. I was almost shitting my pants but again, I had nothing to lose.

He did that a couple more times and told me to let him know in a couple of days how it was. It‚Äôs been 1 month and a half and the PS5 has NEVER turned off again no matter how long it‚Äôs on or what I‚Äôm playing.

So yeah, I would definitely recommend going to a workshop to get this process done to the vent cause it worked flawlessly. Even the noise it‚Äôs lessen.

I think there‚Äôs hope for yours too. It‚Äôs not the end guys! Take it from me, who struggled every day trying to fix it in any way I could. In the end it took a boat expert XD 

Stay safe!",,1650208119

PS5,u5npxs,"If Sony announced a PS5 Pro tomorrow and all it brought to the table was native 4K60fps in AAA games without the need for checker boarding or other upscaling methods, would that be enough to get you to upgrade?","I know some people have still had trouble getting their hands on one but this is all hypothetical.

This generation has finally been the one where 60fps  (or higher) has entered in mainstream appeal. Would a box powerful enough to essentially merge ‚Äúfidelity‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance‚Äù modes be enough to get you want to upgrade? Also considering they‚Äôll want to make a profit would you be willing to pay the premium it costs to do the upgrade, assuming a $100 price increase?",,1650204305
PS5,u5npkj,Am I likely to enjoy Tiny Tina's Wonderlands if I didn't enjoy Borderlands?,"To clarify, 90% of what I disliked about Borderlands was the terrain/theme. I found it very bleak (I know it's supposed to be, not shitting on it), but I've never been a fan of post apocalyptic. I also didn't enjoy the NPC's, but maybe that was because they were part of that world and I just wasn't vibing with them.


Anyway, I hear there's a lot of similarities between them, but without spoilering myself too hard from what I've seen of TTW it looks a lot more colorful and vibrant. In fact it looks pretty great from the photos on the store. But obviously it's not a cheap game, so any thoughts?",,1650204270

Is there somewhere I can get a rundown of the pros and cons of going disc vs digital on PS4 games for the PS5 today?

I know many of the basics (resale, price, PlayStation Plus, etc.), but I‚Äôm also interested to understand how games installation from disc works. Will it load as fast as going digital, will the disc spin up constantly (would prefer as little noise as possible), and things like that. 

Any other tips would be very much appreciated. Totally looking for fussy nuance here.

PS5,u5l41z,this needs addressing,"I just got suspended for a week after some kid threatened to ban me after losing in a rainbow six match. I didn't send or say anything against the terms of service. He straight up mass reported my account and threatened to abuse the report system and he has. 

A fresh smurf account with like 10 games on it fucking mass reports my decade old account with 500+ games on it. I'm not understanding. I report people who send porn and gore to groups on psn and their accounts are still up and fine but I tell a kid to fuck off and leave me alone and I damn near get banned.

 I love sony but the report system is fucking broken and is used constantly against people by toxic ass children.
I pay my subscriptions, I buy games and I haven't had a single report levied against me for the 10 plus years I've been on psn and now in 2022 some stupid ass fortnite and siege playing kid can just get me suspended or worse? 

I've put thousands of dollars into my playstation account over the years and I specifically go out of my fucking way to avoid stuff like this. I literally do everything in my power to avoid toxicity and avoid getting banned and now kids can just fuck me and my account anyway.  Years of games, trophies, data and thousands of dollars can be gone just because some kid lies and reports my swear word. I'm tired of everything I do in games hinging on stupid ass salty ass children. 

I didn't tell this kid to go fuck himself or go kill himself. I told him ""fuck off and leave me alone"" and that's an offense to sony? I bust my ass at work every single day to be able to afford what I do on psn and some stupid ass kid who uses his mommy's credit card can just take all that away from me and others. 
 
So what do I do now everyone. Hope and pray this kid doesn't steal my account from me by getting me banned? Am I at the mercy of some fucking kid now?",,1650194733
PS5,u5ksut,Sound Lag Issues,"Whenever I use my new PS5 I get a delay in the sound after the image has been displayed (it's something like 0.3 seconds). This happens when it's put through the TV speakers, a soundbar and even when I plug headphones into the controller.

What's more it does it for *everything* on the PS5, including streaming apps such as Netflix and YouTube (making them unusable).

I've looked all over Reddit and the wider internet but been unable to find someone else with this specific problem (let alone a solution). If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any potential solutions, I would be very grateful.

PS5,u5gssk,Is forbidden west better than zero dawn?,"A little backstory i just got the ps5 2 days ago with a bundle with forbidden west. I have been an xbox gamer my whole life so i was excited to play forbidden west. I decided to get zero dawn before i play forbidden west and right now im about 10 hours into ZD. I cannot stress enough how disappointing this game is. The story and characters are so mediocre, the combat is also pretty boring. It feels like ive played this type of game a thousand times even though its my first play through i cant bring myself to finish this game but i want to play Forbidden west since it looks absolutely stunning, is it any better than ZD or more of the same formula. If its relatively the same as ZD than i think im just going to sell my copy and buy something else. Thank you (i know im in the minority with my opinion on ZD)",,1650175530
