But in preparation for Ragnarok I bought GoW on PC since it was on sale and I was reminded of how Kratos literally looks perfect. I literally can't imagine skin textures and graphics becoming more realistic than this. I was looking forward to the Ragnarok trailer just for this and it seems like even on the PS5 Kratos looks as well as he did on PS4 GoW. 

How was it possible for them to create such an ahead of its time character model that it still beats anything made a whole console generation later? I seriously don't understand. If someone could ELI5 I'd be very happy.

Even TLOU2 or the TLOU remake or RDR2 despite their beauties and impressive graphics in other areas have character detail at the same realistic level as GoW has with Kratos specifically."

I am going through the PS+ Extra catalogue and one of my main red-flag for games is when they don't feel smooth, actual FPS doesn't matter because for example Death Stranding or any other Sony 1st party games feels great at 30fps, but there are many other games that just have ""jittery camera"" (Shadow Warrior 3 is the latest example I tried), and [this new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMtfexzink8) is a prime example of how bad can it look, am not saying Shadow Warrior is as bad as that, but, consider this video as the worst, and Sony 1st party games are the top of a good 30fps game.

Can you please suggest any game from the Extra catalogue that won't have smoothness issues ?

PS: 

This is not an FPS debate or hate toward anything, I just have a specific preference and am looking for suggestions from people who share the same opinion as me.

PS4,vlnd0k,My experience with the PS4 vs. the PS4 Pro and Vita streaming,"Hi all, 

I am writing this post not because it is particularly pertinent to anyone at the moment, but more so because I want to provide this information to those who may be in my predicament or may have this issue in the future. 

I bought myself a PS Vita a few weeks ago, and I have been absolutely loving it. As a portable gaming console, it is amazing! And while I was upset that the Vita does not offer remote-play to my PS5 (officially or otherwise), I was still very happy that it offers PS4 remote-play. However, even though my PS4 was connected directly to the Ethernet and even though I was playing my Vita right next to the router, the experience when streaming was less than great. While I did not have dropping issues or input-lag, I found that the video would often look terrible due to compression and low bit rate, especially when moving the camera at high speeds, as explained by [this Tom Scott video](https://youtu.be/r6Rp-uo6HmI).

I started to question if the issue was with the PS4, or with the Vita. The network wasn‚Äôt the issue, as I consistently have 300 down and 100 up. However, as some may know, the Vita cannot utilize 5ghz and is limited to roughly 10-15 down/up. So I figured it was one of two options. Either:

1.) The PS4 was too weak to encode and output high-bitrate video at a rate that would be serviceable to good gameplay.

or

2.) The Vita‚Äôs inability to use a faster connection makes the experience run poorly.

Because the issue was low Bitrate and not input lag or dropped or slow connection as I said above, I had a feeling that it was the former. But when I tried to research if the issue would be fixed by getting a PS4 Pro, there was no specific advice in relation to Vita remote play or my situation. While some redditors claimed that the PS4 Pro made remote-play on the phone or computer much better, that did not help in my case because it did not inform whether my issue was (1) or (2). Worse still, when asked this specific question, many redditors speculated that it wouldn‚Äôt help at all, saying that the PS4 and PS4 Pro have similar network capability so not much would change. 

Again, because I speculated that the issue was the PS4‚Äôs power, I did not believe that the network issue had any bearing on the matter. So, I decided to take a leap of faith and try and upgrade my PS4, and it was **so worth it**. 


The extra power makes a huuuuge difference in bitrate quality on the Vita. The experience is amazing, and is as if you were running the games directly on the Vita. 

Though I did not do any ‚Äúscientific‚Äù testing (which I can do on request if it‚Äôs wanted- I haven‚Äôt sold my PS4 yet), my preliminary tests are:

1.) Mafia III - Driving at high speeds (80 mph+) used to be impossible on PS4. Is very responsive, clear, and more importantly, possible, on the pro. 

2.) Spider-Man - Web swing traversal was difficult on PS4. While it was easy enough to do since the process isn‚Äôt super involved, it wasn‚Äôt very fun. On the pro, like I said, responsive and clear- very playable. 

3.) Uncharted 4 - With multiple targets, lots of gunfire and action, managing to dispatch enemies was difficult. Again, on the pro, much easier. Small targets and enemies against black backgrounds are now clearly legible, with the only limiting factor being the Vita‚Äôs low native resolution. 

4.) CoD Infinite Warfare - Basically the same improvements as Uncharted 4.

5.) AC Valhalla - The excessive foliage in comparison to other games absolutely demolishes the bitrate while streaming. All around unplayable on the PS4, and it was not worth the trouble playing. No problems playing for extended periods of time on the PS4 Pro at all. Honestly, this is probably the most remoteable game I‚Äôve played so far.

Anyway.. that‚Äôs about it. I just wanted to share my observations on the matter. As the PS Vita starts to regain some traction of interested again, I hope that this will have helped someone. While this is not entirely an endorsement to just go out and get a PS4 Pro, I consider it very useful information that is important to share for others to make informed decisions- especially when all information that exists at the moment is misleading or unhelpful.  Feel free to ask me any questions about it. Thanks!

TL;DR - Yes, the PS4 Pro provides a much greater experience when remote streaming to the PS Vita than the PS4."

My wife had been wanting for me to get a PS5 for a while and I refuse to pay scalpers so I decided to wait until plenty titles had been released and I had all the games to play when I got mine eventually. It was our anniversary and Father's day recently so she kept mentioning trying to get one. We signed up for the Playstation website list and Amazon list about a week ago. No hits or emails back and she said maybe we should call stores and see if they have any. I decided to try the Gamestop I used to go to a few years ago, before I started solely downloading games to my ps4's upgraded ssd. I asked if they have any disc drive PS5 consoles? The nice lady says ""yes we do."" I was floored, my oldest son didn't believe me! I asked them to hold it for me under my name and I would be there shortly. My wife says she can order an extra controller via Amazon if they don't have the color we want. 

I get there and its fairly busy and my heart sinks a little because I have put stuff on hold at Gamestop and it was sold before I got there (not this store in particular) and it bummed me out. I get to the nice associate and explain to her that I have a PS5 on hold. She starts to ring up my order from a big 3 ring binder with all the sku #s in it. It comes up to around $860! Looking at the little breakdown I see like 4 games, an extra red controller (not the color we wanted), and a charging station. I said ""Thats not my order I am here for the disc drive PS5."" She says all they sell are the bundles. I got pretty upset, because that was way beyond the budget we had in min.  Two games in the bundle I already had and the third of four I didnt want at all (Battlefield). I call home and tell my Wife and she says, ""tell them you don't want those games.""  I am pretty un-confrontational and there is a line behind me. I get too nervous and I leave. My wife gives me this pep talk saying, to tell the employee that the lady on the phone didn't say that it was a bundle. We had planned on buying games digitally anyway. So my wife said to see if they could do a swap out of all the games I didn't want for ones I did. All they can say is no and we can try calling other stores for the console only if they couldn't break-up the bundle. I waited until the store cleared out and I get back up to the same girl and say, ""I'm sorry but I'm pretty disappointed. I'm not mad at you, but I called and wasn't told this was only bundled PS5's. I already own Horizon, and this other game. I don't want these games. Can I break the bundle and choose the games I'm getting so I will at least get the games I want?"" She doesn't say a word and looks irritated, but she busts out the binder and starts ringing me up. I look and not only were they games I had no interest in or games I had already they were the super duper editions at $89, $79, etc. overpriced! I sai, ""I'd love Ratchet and Clank, my son wants Elden Ring, and ideally instead of red remote I'd prefer the purple."" She just quietly rung up and grabbed everything I asked for. She said she cannot take off the charging station, but that is OK for me. The total ended up being $780 with sales tax (8.35%), but I got 2 games and the controller I wanted, with the charging station. So in the end I got what I wanted and they got their sale. I just wanted to share my experience so you know there is potential for customizing these bundles at Gamestop. Another requirement was that you were a Pro member, so I did have to pay $15 to add that for the year, but with the renewal points and purchase  points I will already have a $20 credit to use on my next purchase. 


Tl;dr got a PS5 and changed the bundle games at gamestop.
I hope you guys get your PS5 too!"

A new [PlayStation](https://comicbook.com/category/playstation-generic/) report may shed light on a future and big console exclusive game for the PS4 and PS5. Yesterday, we relayed word of [a new report](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/playstation-ps5-pro-controller-headsets-monitors-hardware-leak/) that claimed PlayStation was preparing to reveal three new gaming headsets and two new gaming monitors next week under the branding ""INZONE."" 

Not long after we relayed this report, [Sony](https://comicbook.com/category/sony/) confirmed a special presentation is happening on June 28. Promoting this representation, it used the tagline ""Find Your New Zone,"" which is an obvious reference to ""INZONE."""

PC advantages of buying Sony games
- FREE ONLINE
- Sony may create their own steam equivalent at some point with trophy/friends list etc
- Cheaper games
- Mods!
- No need to rebuy games you bought
- Will likely have better graphic playstation games as time progresses

Playstation Advantages 
- Simplicity
- Currently the first place to get sony games

That's it...

The free online especially,  i don't see Sony going ban to how it was on Playstation 3 with free online multiplayer and I've seen a lot of awesome mods done to Playstation games that we also don't have access to.

We've been going through this one and have every other achievement. All red bricks, all Hogwarts crests, all students in peril, all True Wizard, all spells learned, 199/200 gold bricks, all characters unlocked except for Voldemort.

We did snag [the tricky gold brick](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960495-lego-harry-potter-years-1-4/55458453) sweeping the floor of the emporium on Diagon Alley, which apparently is one that is easy to miss.

After the kid went to bed, I went back through I believe every ding dang room in Hogwarts. Before we got the gold brick in Diagon Alley, the brick detector was going off in Diagon Alley and in both rooms of the emporium. After, the only rooms where a detector went off were the library and restricted section, which I know to be [a bug with the house crest detector](https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/a01e9w/help_me_please_1_gold_brick_left_to_get_years_14/).

The title is self-explanatory, but some context:

I bought the game last night on my PS4 and played it for ~3 hours. Love at first sight.

Then I woke up early today, really excited to play the game before work.

Once I hit ""Continue"", it takes forever to load. In fact, it hasn't loaded yet. First time I waited 5 minutes and thought something was wrong. Closed the game and opened it again.

Now I just looked at my stopwatch app... OVER 25 MINUTES to load the game!

I've never seen anything like that in my whole life playing video games. I'm not playing on a PC with low requirements, it's a PS4. The game is sold for the console.

Hey fellas i need you guys help for real 
I bought a PS4 slim last year after i struggled to obtain a ps5.
I have played some games that i wanted to when I was a PC gamer 

But now , i was lucky enough to order a ps5 and guess what, it's confirmed and i will be getting it before July 3rd.

But now i am in a dilemma folks.

On one hand  i am thinking it's a waste of money on ps5 when I already have PS4 slim to play games.

On the other hand I am in the mindset that i was able to acquire ps5 and lucky enough for it and it will be useful in future.

So i am in a bit of contradiction folks.
So i need ur help to sort this out.

Ps: sorry for the length post and folks please ignore this post  if u guys think i am weird for asking this question"

PS4,vjhi2i,That one game youll never delete off your ps4. You got one?,"Man i really need to invest in an external hard drive. As someone who has a 500gb ps4, i find myselr having to delete games often to make space to play new ones. Almost everyone ive spoken to about this has a game that theyll never delete off their ps4. The reasons vary from it being a sentimental thing, their fav game holdin a special spot in their heart, a social thing where they play/talk with friends, a backlog thing, game they savor and still comin back to, to beat, etc.. Im almost embarassed to share what game i never delete cuz its anthem lol. Its mainly a social thing cuz i made a lot of friends on this game and no matter what state im in, i can mess around in. From the people ive spoken to about this, the most popular games i heard were gta5, rdr2, and some variation of a COD game. Also a few ghosts of tsushimas. Do you have a game youll never delete off of your ps4? Is there a game youve never deleted for whatever reason? Im curious and would love to know what game/s.. if you dont mind sayin why you chose that game, itd be appreciated too"

&amp;#x200B;

You have to use the website/app to claim the DLC. If you look at this DLC it shows ""purchased"" and says ""You already own another edition.""

&amp;#x200B;

You need click the ""Free"" option and ""Add to Library"". This will properly unlock DLC on your account.

I don't get it. It's such a money grab because when my family purchases games, it can't used unless we set the Users to Primary. My sibling has their own Playstation and I made the mistake of purchasing all my games on their account and now I can't use it on my Playstation without having to go through a whole fuss. Also games that link through PSN are a pain now too, because when I first started playing I used another person's account and now I can't link it through my account even though I made in-game purchases and my level histories are all saved onto the former account.

It is a fantastic console, and it deserves to be popular for sure. What I dont understand is why people prefer it to xbox. I get that there are some good exclusives, in fact I 100% Spider-Man within a week or two and it wasn't even the only thing I played, but I dont see those few games as reason to prefer a whole console. I prefer the hardware, menus, controllers, settings, store, even the keyboard on Xbox. Xbox has even seemed more reliable to me. I am genuinely curious why you like PlayStation more than Xbox.

PS4,vgr5rh,Controller won't connect," Alright so I bought a PS4 with two controllers few weeks ago, and one of them worked just fine with the cable that came with the console, the other controller gets an orange light in the back, the light starts flashing but it does not connect. The thing is, I tested the controller on my phone so I know it works, how do I fix this? I tryed it in a friends console and the controller doesnt work in his console either.

Ps: Already tried the little hole in the back, other cable and most of the common procedure on the internet.

Thanks in advance."

PS4,vgnuao,Games you can suggest to my kind of playstyle,"I absolutely loved playing the AC games especially Odyssey and Origins, Insomniac‚Äôs SM games, the most recent GOW. I enjoy trailing off to the side quests and obtaining all the cool shit the game offers before getting into the main story. I‚Äôm looking for games that offer tons of collectibles that gives advantages to the character and at the same time gives amazing visuals. What kind of games can you guys suggest? I‚Äôve tried to start Horizon Zero Dawn but got bored during the first 30 minutes, am I missing out?"

PS4,vgdh8g,PSA: TMNT: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge has an inferior Co-op experience on PlayStation,"Gotta say since I barely see enough talk about this online. 

For SOME reason the PlayStation version of Shredder‚Äôs Revenge is the ONLY one that doesn‚Äôt allow more than 2 people on local to mix and match with online friends. 

I can understand only allowing up to 4 players on local since the PS4 and PS5 only support 4 total controllers. But there‚Äôs literally no technical reason for the limitations on online. 

I just tried playing online tonight with a friend and his wife and we‚Äôre both on PS5. She couldn‚Äôt join on the same console with him since the online on PS maxes out at 1 per console. 

Had we bought it on Switch instead we would‚Äôve had no issue, in our defense the 6 player online mixed with local co-op was literally an advertised feature from the Casey Jones reveal trailer that was from SONY‚ÄôS State of Play/the Official PS Blog like a week ago here: https://youtu.be/hAhoHGXPp8U

Understandably we are quite annoyed with this and it‚Äôs made even worse since we have under an hour in total playtime and Sony‚Äôs refund policy on PlayStation is trash compared to something like Steam. 

TL;DR: PS4/5 for co-op mixing online with local: the local player can only play by themselves (1 per console). There is no way to mix and match more players online with local on PlayStation. EVERY OTHER VERSION does not have this limitation. 

CAN the devs patch this feature in if enough noise is made online? I bet they would‚Äôve had it on day 1 but Sony wanted it left out for WHATEVER reason. 

If you care about having a feature rich co-op experience please choose literally any other platform and support the devs of this amazing game."

So, I have a ps4 controller I usually use on PC with PS Now, but I recently got an 8BitDo SN 30 Pro+ controller because the ps4 ones' sticks started drifting. Now, the controller works great, button  mapping is  pretty  much 1:1 for the standard dualshock minus the obvious touchpad.

The problem however, seems to be a rather odd one. The SN30 Pro+ HAS a Start button, but for some reason that button doesn't register AS a start button (or have any other noticeable action) in ANY game on the  service. This usually doesn't matter for a majority of games where the Start button is just a generic pause like a lot of RPGs, but I've been coming across a lot of games where you can't even get off the title  screen without first pushing the Start button.

So what can I do besides plugging the dualshock in for random start button presses? Has anyone  else come across this kind of problem before?"

PS4,vfawlf,Water cooling my PS4 to reduce fan noise,"The fan in my PS4 was noisy when playing open world games, even after cleaning the dust out of the heatsink and PSU. I found some posts where people attached large CPU coolers to the heatsink on the bottom of the PS4 and I decided to use a similar method to attach a water cooling system.

Here are some photos of my PS4 with a small water block attached to the heatsink, a water pump, a large radiator, a fan and a controller. The water pump and fan still make some noise, but it's much quieter - similar to the noise made by the DVD drive.

[https://imgur.com/a/rgQ8WS3](https://imgur.com/a/rgQ8WS3)

The photos show where I cut away the plastic from the bottom cover and heatsink cover. I used some thermal adhesive tape to attach the water block, and I attached some wires to the 12v PSU output for the fan controller. I used a double radiator, but a single one would be fine. It keeps the PS4 heatsink cool, which keeps the PS4 fan running quietly. I no longer have to play games with subtitles on!

PS4,ve6n31,PS4 freeze with controller blinking when downloading FIX (Solution),"Those of you that are having the issue with your PS4 freezing up when downloading a game.  
After a few months of trial and error I finally found a fix.  
The Problem lays in the internal HDD  
Replace your internal HDD but DO NOT MAKE AND RESTORE A BACKUP doing this will cause the problem to return just install the firmware fresh   
Back story about six months ago this started for me. At first I thought is was my external drive because when I would change ports the problem went away then would come back so I switched to another usb port it would go away and then about 3 months ago I had to switch to the third port and haven't had an issue since until about three days ago.  
So now I was at a loss of what it could be so I change the settings making the internal drive the install drive that seemed to work for a game or two but normally once it got between 6 and 10 GB it would freeze.  
At this time I was starting to notice stuttering in some games or lag so I rebuilt the database when the ps4 rebooted I get a message that GTA V is installed on both internal and external so I tell it to delete the internal version but the problem got worse it would now freeze anywhere between 4 and 6GB and when playing GTA V when exiting out of building started to take much longer than normal.  
At this point I determined it was the internal HDD failing so to do a little test I did a restore database before I made a backup and when it booted back up I got the warning that GTV was installed on both drives.  
Yesterday I went out and bought an SSD for it installed it and restored the backup (BIG MISTAKE)  
Once the restore was done all the problems were back including GTA V being on both drives.  
So I went into recovery and wiped the system but the freezing still persisted.  
So I went back into recovery and did a complete reinstall of the firmware and all issues have been resolved.  
Now I did not try reinstalling the firmware on the old HDD so those of you that are having this issue can try that and report back your results.  
I hope this info helps others."

Returnal, Spidey-Miles, GoTG, Demon‚Äôs Souls, AC Valhalla, Ghost of Tshusima (already own ghost of easily a top 10 game so imma put that up here). 

I wasn‚Äôt expecting games like Diablo 2, or Hot Wheels or anything that‚Äôs not directly related to Sony but I fully expected their older Sony exclusive titles to make the list like Sackboy Adventures. I know Forbbiden West came out in February/March, hard months to compete with Dying Light 2 and Elden Ring, but that was over 3 months ago, isn‚Äôt that old enough to put in your ‚Äúpremium‚Äù catalog? Kind of off topic but I hate that when I categorize by platform (ps5) that it still brings up old titles like toy story 2 and shows me it‚Äôs release date as 6/13/22, like can you at least put the real release date not the catalog release date.

Over the last couple years I've gone deep into a few survivor games, such as The Long Dark, Green Hell, Subnautica, and recently Dysmantle.

I am absolutely in love with the immersion and depth these video games bring. However, I'm starting to feel a bit... lonely?.. in-game as there aren't any real life players to interact with.

So I ask you, oh PS4 subreddit, what online survival games do you recommend? Something that tries to maintain that immersion these survival games bring to the table. Maybe something like Dying Light where I'm able to join a random players game and help them with their progression.

Thanks, all!"
PS4,vbufh9,"after a decade of begging for it, Ape Escape is on the PS Store","With the launch of the new PS Plus, a handful of PS Classics have made their way to the PS4 Store. Among those classics is the original Ape Escape. Ape Escape was the first game to truly innovate the Dualshock Controller, it really showed just how much you can do with that design. I truly think it played a big role in modern day console controllers keeping up with the classic Dualshock design and it never gets the respect it deserves. Ape Escape has been my favorite game since childhood and to this day it is still my favorite video game. I know all the scores by heart and can say most of the English dub scripting by heart. I'm so happy to see this game get some respect for once, and I really hope that this will expose more kids to the greatness of this game. The only thing that could make this better is if someone FINALLY remasters the first 3 games. (Looking at you Toys for Bob)"

PS4,vbl75b,The Transition from PSNow to PSPlus E/P: I ‚Äúown‚Äù games now that I didn‚Äôt before,"As you guys probably know, Sony has overhauled psnow into a tiered subscription service incorporating psplus, with many games in your library showing as psnow titles now seemlessly turning into psplus ones; unfortunately all of these games like trails of cold steel or the oddly expansive selection of sonic games didn‚Äôt make the cut, so if you had them in your library they‚Äôll just show up locked or just blank with no symbol indicating you can download or it‚Äôs part of psplus whenever you hover over it in the ‚ÄúYour Collection‚Äù section on PS5.

However, this isn‚Äôt the case for all the games that didn‚Äôt make the transition, as preluded by the title, some appear as though I own them, meaning they appear with only a simple download arrow, as If I‚Äôve purchased it through the digital ps store and didn‚Äôt obtain them through psnow/psplus. 

The games that show up that I have purchased but have not are as follows: 

Anodyne
Milk Gakkou Monogatari: K√§se Episode
Minutes
Blood Bowl
Firefighters: The simulation 
The Metronomicon
A Bastard‚Äôs tale
And maybe OlliOlli2, I‚Äôm not sure about that one.

And whenever I try to download these, it‚Äôs of these two results, I press the plain text download button and it loads indefinitely or it loads only for split second and then the button is greyed out, unable to be interacted with. 

So, uhhh‚Ä¶ has this happened with you? I thought it was interesting behavior so it was best to catalog it somewhere on the internet. I wonder if on Sony‚Äôs servers if it flags me as some would be hacker trying to download games I don‚Äôt own."

PS4,vb9o36,"Opinion: Sony Should Look To Capcom &amp; Square Enix For Guidance On Live-Services, Not Bungie","Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I started posting opinion pieces on my blog (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post that here) and I was wondering if anyone here would be willing to provide some feedback?

Here's the link: [https://brotaku.net/2022/05/30/opinion-sony-should-look-to-capcom-square-enix-for-guidance-on-live-services-not-bungie/](https://brotaku.net/2022/05/30/opinion-sony-should-look-to-capcom-square-enix-for-guidance-on-live-services-not-bungie/)

I'm also going to attach the entire post here so you don't have to click on the link (although I'd appreciate it if you did):

Over the past couple of months Jim Ryan, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, began to unveil PlayStation‚Äôs interest in live-service titles, something that didn‚Äôt necessarily excite PlayStation fans. Each time Ryan speaks about live-service titles it brings out a feeling of dread because the video game company that had championed singleplayer games for years appeared to be doing a 180-degree flip.

Whilst Sony Interactive Entertainment won‚Äôt be abandoning singleplayer games entirely, just essentially halving its investment in them, it‚Äôs still easy to see why PlayStation fans are concerned about this obsession with live-service titles. Live-service games aren‚Äôt always bad the overwhelming majority of them are, a good live-service game is generally the exception to the rule. Live-service games don‚Äôt respect your time, they drip-feed you content and in far too many cases, publishers put out an unfinished or broken game with the expectation that you‚Äôll stick around long enough for it to become good.

Bungie has released one of the most beloved and popular live-service titles of all time with Destiny 2, breaking free of Activision it built on its vision whilst making the game more accessible. Whilst Destiny 2 is a great example of what a successful live-service game can look like it‚Äôs not necessarily the best. Both Capcom and Square Enix have far better examples of a live-service game than Bungie‚Äôs Destiny 2. Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV could both have served as the perfect blueprint for Sony Interactive Entertainment and neither would have required a massive acquisition fee.

**The Destiny 2 Content Problem**

The biggest issue Destiny 2 has is content and how the game delivers it. It feels like everything is drip-fed and nothing is ever truly fleshed out. This approach works for some games but for most, it‚Äôs just frustrating, in the case of Destiny 2 it‚Äôs the latter. The world of Destiny is truly amazing and there‚Äôs so much potential to tell great stories but sadly Destiny 2 hardly ever manages to deliver. The Red War (base game) campaign was decent and the Forsaken expansion is probably the best story ever told in the Destiny universe but neither of these two is accessible today.

In 2020 Bungie announced plans to remove content from Destiny 2 in order to make the game easier to manage and maintain, as part of a new ‚Äúcontent vault‚Äù Bungie would continuously add and remove parts of the game. This was also done due to Bungie‚Äôs decision to increase Destiny 2‚Äòs support instead of releasing a Destiny 3. Since introducing the program, Bungie has removed paid content for the game and has essentially made Destiny 2 more unwelcoming for new players, making it seem like the game was built for the hardcore or extremely casual player.

Destiny 2 is a game you have to commit fully to and risk getting burnt out or you have to accept that you‚Äôre never going to get the full Destiny experience and play casually. In which case you‚Äôre essentially going to be repeating the same strikes or playing competitive modes. In a normal live-service game like Apex Legends or Genshin Impact that would be fine because the design is more modern whereas Destiny 2 often comes across as prehistoric. Multiplayer modes are from an era in which most first-person games have moved on from and the entire hub and map system are far too restricting.

As someone that went from Destiny to Destiny 2 and then to Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV, it became painfully clear as to just how bad Bungie have been mismanaging this series. Both Monster Hunter: World and Final Fantasy XIV have issues, Monster Hunter: World has the most convoluted multiplayer system I‚Äôve ever used and Final Fantasy XIV gets overwhelming with the number of quests and information the game throws at you. These issues are minor grievances in comparison to all that Bungie get wrong with Destiny 2.

Both Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World actually respect your time and money, Final Fantasy XIV has more content in the base game than Destiny has across all expansions. Comparing expansions doesn‚Äôt do much good for Bungie either as expansions in either of those games offer a lot more than even two of Destiny‚Äòs expansions combined. It‚Äôs almost as if we‚Äôve been conditioned to accept less from Destiny 2. Then you can look at how those games manage content, neither of those games removes paid-for content or campaigns. The campaign is the player‚Äôs introduction to the world and the fact that Bungie is so willing to toss it aside is actually quite scary.

Finally, you can compare how each game is managed and this is where it feels like Bungie is giving its fans the finger. Both Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World are packed to the brim with content, Final Fantasy XIV, in particular, has more content than any game I‚Äôve ever played and yet neither of these games cut out significant quests. The only quests Monster Hunter: World removed are licensed collaborations, none of which have any real impact on the game. Final Fantasy XIV and Monster Hunter: World are the two best live-service games out there and both of them were made by studios that had no major experience in the field.

Destiny 2 is an absolute mess, especially for new players. Regardless of how difficult it is to manage Destiny 2 Bungie have no real justification for cutting content, especially content that people paid for. Bungie began the live-service revolution and is among the most experienced developers in the multiplayer market so it‚Äôs quite baffling to see just how much they get wrong. Destiny 2 isn‚Äôt revolutionizing anything with its seasonal content and expansions, so regardless of difficult it is to ‚Äúefficiently update and maintain‚Äù there‚Äôs no justification for the existence of a Destiny content vault. What it essentially boils down to is laziness and publishers trying to see just how much they can get away with.

**The Core Of A Live-Service Game**

As you can see, Destiny 2 is far from the perfect, or even ideal, live-service game. Despite the game‚Äôs issues, it‚Äôs actually quite easy to fix, simple tweaks alone would make the game a far better experience. That‚Äôs because making a live-service game isn‚Äôt all that complicated, it only becomes so when developers build the game around keeping you playing for as long as possible without a care for the actual content and when monetization becomes the priority.

Reading that last paragraph you may be thinking ‚Äúif live-service games are so easy to get right why aren‚Äôt there more good ones?‚Äù Admittedly, you‚Äôre probably not thinking that but it does help with the flow of this piece. Regardless, the answer to your, or rather my own, question is that these games don‚Äôt have to be good to succeed. In most cases they simply need to work in order to find an audience, in other cases minimal effort and slapping a big name to it can also do the trick.

If you look at the moderately successful live-service games, like Fallout 76 or Dauntless, you can clearly see that you don‚Äôt need to put much into these games to be successful. In fact, both of these seem to be the blueprint publishers and developers follow when releasing one. Fallout 76 was a $60 game, lacked meaningful content and was broken at launch, post-launch it introduced a subscription model and built upon the microtransactions. Dauntless on the other hand is a free-to-play title that relies on season passes and microtransactions whilst releasing content updates every couple of months.

Neither of these games is great but they do just enough to hold your attention. That‚Äôs all a live-service game needs to do. If you look at the trends of gaming over the last 10 years it‚Äôs not really hard to see why live-service games are so popular. We went from the online craze to the era of free-to-play and whilst both of these brought about some truly terrible experiences they also introduced us to some unforgettable times. A live-service is, at least in my mind, a metamorphosis of both.

A live-service game should ideally be one where you get the multiplayer fix you‚Äôve been looking for along with the promise of it being supported for years. This on its own already sounds great but it also costs a great deal to maintain, which is why these games are often filled with microtransactions and expansions. The good live-service games either give you enough meaningful free content where you won‚Äôt mind spending a little extra money through season passes or the dreaded lootbox, or they‚Äôll give you a meaty paid expansion in which you‚Äôll get hours worth of new content.

Live-service games only really need two or three things going for them in order to find some success. It can be something as simple as character design, art style, gameplay or even just a big IP. The next big factor is accessibility, it‚Äôs no secret that a game will be more successful if it‚Äôs available on more platforms but this goes doubly so for live-service games and multiplayer games in general. Finally comes the support, something which Sony has admitted been quite poor at. A live-service game needs to be supported for years otherwise it will die off, Overwatch is the perfect example of this.

Support doesn‚Äôt just need to come from the content side but also in the way of balancing the game. Live-service games are constantly evolving. Players are always finding new exploits and meta‚Äôs, this means that developers need to stay on top of things. Something which Sony have no experience with. Regardless if we look at some of Sony Interactive Entertainment‚Äôs existing IPs you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs actually quite simple to convert some of them into live-service games.

If we take something like The Last of Us, all you need to do is build on the Factions game mode. Add some story content and create a hub and you‚Äôre already halfway there. Killzone is already primed and ready to become a Destiny-like live-service game. Dormant IPs like Resistance and Soul Sacrifice or Freedom Wars are perfect for the live-service model. Soul Sacrifice already saw a huge boom last year on Vita and a modernised version for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC would immediately find an audience.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that Sony could have begun its live-service venture without the huge investment of acquiring Bungie. It could have also done this the smart way, not by increasing its funding in live-service games to 55% by 2025 but rather by testing the waters. Going down this route would have allowed Sony to enter the market without sacrificing a huge chunk of what made PlayStation special and without spending a huge sum on money, money that could have been used to strengthen its existing development teams.

**Closing**

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bungie will be a huge help in the path Sony Interactive Entertainment is heading on. The experience Bungie has will pave the way for Sony‚Äôs live-service push but there‚Äôs also a great deal to be concerned about. Sony Interactive Entertainment has made it clear with the acquisition of Bungie, the talent retainment fund it has set aside and the creation of the Sony Interactive Entertainment Live Service Centre of Excellence that it wants Bungie to lead this push but there‚Äôs a lot that Bungie get wrong.

Destiny 2 is unkind to newcomers and casual players and it has issues with content and how it manages it. Worst of all is that Bungie doesn‚Äôt really see any of this as an issue. Sony Interactive Entertainment could very well pick up these bad habits and given that Sony wants Bungie to review all aspects of the development cycle for its live-service games it could also end up plaguing all of PlayStation Studios‚Äô live-service titles. Live-service titles aren‚Äôt bad, not when they respect your time. Destiny 2 does not and there are only so many of these kinds of games that you can play and dedicate your time to. Sony plan on having 12 live-service games out by the 2025 financial year and if they‚Äôre all run like Destiny 2 they won‚Äôt be sustainable, regardless of how different they are.

Sony‚Äôs interest in live-service games isn‚Äôt a surprise, they‚Äôve seen how much money they make from the PlayStation Network and now it wants a piece of the action. It‚Äôs just going about it the wrong way. Capcom and Square Enix have both been stepping up their efforts in the multiplayer department but they are doing so without sacrificing the core of what made them the monoliths they are. PlayStation has been breaking a legacy that it strived so hard to build with the PS4 and its obsession with live-service games is just the next step towards that."

PS4,v9rwy9,What Have I Missed? Must Play Games,"TLDR; What are some games and experiences that only Sony PlayStation can offer?  Such as Ghosts of Tsushima and Shadows of the Colossus.


Hey all.  New PS4 Pro owner here.  This is my first PlayStation console.  

Im looking for game recommendations that are distinctly Sony/PlayStation.  Experiences that only PlayStation can provide.

For example, Shadow of the Colossus, The Last Guardian and Ghosts of Tsushima seem like games you can only play and experience on a PlayStation console.

Those are the games I'm looking for.  Already on my list are the main exclusives.  God of War, Spiderman, Horizons etc.  

What else am I missing that fills this niche?  PS3 and PS4 games mainly.

Thanks all, much appreciated!"

I'm a huge fan of the humble SHMUP, a genre that doesn't get nearly enough love these days. What are people's favourite SHMUPs on the PS4, that are \*currently available\*?

I think my current top picks would have to be:

\- Sky Force Reloaded (for the sheer amount of content on there. It keeps you coming back for more and is possibly the best value for money of the genre I've ever played).

\- Shikhondo (because it might be the most beautiful SHMUP I've ever seen. Not the deepest in terms of gameplay, but everything, from the menus to the gameplay, is absolutely gorgeous)"

PS4,v8eqo8,Do I NEED a new controller? (Stick drift),"So first off, this is actually about my Dualsense controller, but can't post on the Ps5 forum for some reason... 

Anyway, the same principle applies. 

So I've had some stick drift for a little while that's gotten worse and worse. I then thought, screw this, and used quite a bit of contact cleaner sprayed into the analogue stick. 

Since then, the controller has been fine. No issues whatsoever. 

I've had my eye on at least 3 games coming this year, and everything needs replacing/repairing atm - Need a plumber, new PC etc, so as money is not infinite lol, I would rather not buy a new controller that'll likely get stick drift as well soon if I can.

On the otherhand, Duelsense controllers are on sale atm at ¬£48, which a decent saving, and the sale ends soon(ish).

So yeah, can I get away with sticking with my current controller? As I say, i would really be pissed if I got a new one and it too has stick drift. 

Read so many stories of people buying the coloured ones that supposedly have better springs that also get stick drift very quickly. 

Anyway, thanks in advance."

And NHL game that I'm not really interested in playing anyways. All I cared about was that the console and control were brand new in box. 
I got it for $150 canadian tax included because it was like %60 off. I ended up getting all the games I wanted from the ps store and I was feeling like I got a steal on it. Now I'm surprised that my friends are making fun of me for getting a ps4 pro 1 tb . They were like why would you get that piece of crap? Get a ps5 instead.

PS4,v6bfu4,PlayStation's refund policy is straight garbage,"So I tell me how I purchased a game for my PS4 that was giving me issues from the start. I'm talking stuttering noises in the main menu, huge frame drops when navigating just the menu, then crashing with an error code during every loading screen. 

Reached out to support to resolve the issue rather than go straight to a refund cause I know how stingy they are with that. We went through every step and at the end the rep suggests I pay to send my console in for service despite this being the only game I have any issues with.

At that point, I felt the need to speak up and say hey, it's definitely not my console, I think this game may just be poorly optimized for PS4. I requested a refund to my account balance so that I could use it in the PSN store on a different title, not even to my original payment method cause I figured there was a better shot at going that route. 

Still no dice. Told me as per the policy, if you download or stream a game that's that. But like, how would I know a game has issues unless I try to play it? It also had decent review ratings when I looked at it in the store. When I looked up my error codes from the crashes, it specifically says ""the application stopped working,"" pretty cut and dry as far as I'm concerned, especially after having gone through all the troubleshooting steps and still having the issue. 

The rep suggested I pursue it with the game's publisher, but like, I got it on YOUR store. Aren't there supposed to be measures in place for titles made available on the PSN store? Where's the quality control? 

Every other platform where similar things have happened i.e. a game being too buggy or poorly optimized to run, once the issue persists after troubleshooting or it's been escalated to a supervisor, they issue a refund in some form. 

I didn't even want the money back in full, just store credit to go towards a different title. Steam, Xbox, hell even Nintendo who's pretty bad with customer service too will play ball. But no, PlayStation will stick to their guns to a fault and it's extremely anti-consumer and likely to lead to legal issues as time moves forward and digital refunds become the new norm. 


Tl;Dr PlayStation will not issue refunds for broken digital games."

PS4,v65dlv,I'm playing a game now that has its title spelled wrong on the trophy list. Anyone seen that before?,"I just bought **Lode** Runner Legacy and was amazed to find that the name of the game is spelled incorrectly on the trophy list you access from the main menu. It's spelled ""**Load** Runner Legacy"" there. The name is spelled correctly when you pull up the trophy list by holding the controller's PS button while the game is running.

Has anyone seen something like this before? It's a pretty hilarious mistake on someone's part and I guess they couldn't fix it after the game was released. I assume this would be Playstation's error and not the developer's?

The game is pretty fun. Most of the modes give it a new coat of paint with the characters, enemies, and levels having more detail, although I prefer the simpler Classic mode that gives the player that familiar stick figure appearance. 

I loved playing Lode Runner back on an Apple IIc and Commodore 64 and figured it'd be worth the $8 I paid for it on sale, which it is. That's saying something because other than maybe this game, I have almost zero nostalgia to play games that look and sound like they're from that era."

Then my console decided to freeze and wouldn't unfreeze no matter what, so I had no other choice but to shut it off by holding the power button for 20 seconds. Upon completion and then turning on the console again, I was greeted with the checking system memory prompt followed by a restart which was followed by the warning that the PS4 was not turned off properly. I think that this is strange since this should only occur when the PS4 was closed by closing the electricity or by removing the power cable. Also I don't know if that helps but after that incident my PS4 decided to not show me my music activity and game list on my profile, rather than that everything works fine.

Me and my other friend, I‚Äôll refer to him as friend1, were playing with the 7yo when someone in a group we were all in started calling 7yo fat and cursing at him.   Me and Friend1 do not take kindly to bullies and we told him to grow up and that he‚Äôs acting like a 10 year old. He then said he was 13 as if that was something to be proud of and then proceeded to curse at us and show pictures of 7yo. I get livid and start chewing him out, might I add not cursing, until 7yo‚Äôs parents start typing in chat and it‚Äôs pretty clear that 7yo isn‚Äôt faking his parents typing at least to me.  13yo starts cursing at them and calling 7yo ‚Äúfat f**k‚Äù and ‚Äúp**sy‚Äù and other names that you should not call really anyone old let alone a 7 year old.

As a reminder, the following threads are no longer allowed on [r/PS4](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/) and will be removed:

* **Tech Support questions** (""I have a problem"", ""My controller doesn't work"", ""I can't connect to PSN""...)
* **Game recommendation** (""Which game should I get?"", ""Is this game good?"")
* **General questions** (""Where can I get a PS4?"", ""What do you think of this controller?"")

**Those questions now have to be asked in this thread**. It will be renewed at 12:00 PM EST on Mondays and Fridays.

This thread is sorted by **New answers by default**. Sorting it by Top or Best could give answers to commonly answered questions.

Also, don't forget to google your question first - you might find the answer before asking it here!"

PS4,v3w1x9,Graphics upscale glitch?,"Hi, my PS4 has developed this odd issue recently and while it may not seem so bad initially, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until it crashes and the controller lag makes playing very difficult. 

‚Ä¢Upon starting the console up I‚Äôll notice more vivid colours and a sharper resolution on the menu screen. This happens maybe 1 times out of 10. 

‚Ä¢I only noticed it at the start when playing Far Cry 6. It has never done it before then. I have been playing that and Just cause 3 recently, it happens on both games.

‚Ä¢The graphics look like they have been upscaled with a sharper resolution and much better looking colours. It really looks great! 

‚Ä¢The game and system will not run as smooth however and is bad for dropping frame rate.

‚Ä¢The controller has a good second of delay between commands and anything happening in the game.

‚Ä¢It will run for approx 25-30 mins then crash. 50/50 chance of it reverting to normal or still being the same. It will keep crashing until the graphics return to normal. 

I have taken the TV out of the equation, it is definitely not the TV or monitor i am playing on. It doesn‚Äôt matter what mode the TV is on. I am beginning to get worried it‚Äôs going to cook itself and do some kind of yellow light of death that the PS3 got lol. What on earth could be wrong with it? Has anyone experienced anything like this?"

PS4,v355rm,Ps4 is the most successful console of all time. I wanna know from you why (Ty),"They sell approximately 15-18 games per console (1.8B / 120M)

Nintendo 6-8

Xbox, well they operate more with Gamepass. 

We all know that the money is in the software sales, not hardware sales. 

Why do you think is sony selling so many games? The competition has the same amount of consoles (switch, Wii had even more than the ps3))

Ps4 is the most successful console of all time. With today approximately 1.8,1.9 billion games sold (April 2021 1.6 billion)Why? Wanna know your opinion

Thank you. 

Please no fanboy nonsense."

I have no problems with other games.

But $25 (preowned) for dying light 2, a fairly new game is still really good too. I havent played either series.

Then when the game was installed, I had to wait for the game to load before I could move past the title screen to start playing. I play far enough to beat the second level of the tutorial before I'm kicked back to the title screen. Then when I tried to log in, the game tries to load extra data for the next Quest and...my console crashed and had to rebuild its databse. 

I already sent Sony a report but this made me stressed and disappointed enough I have to post about it here to warn any Bleach fans out there. I'm stressed because my console could've gotten bricked and disappointed that a Bleach game somehow is buggier then a Bethesda game as someone who felt nostalgia seeing the game's opening and seeing in color before the new anime comes out the 1,000 Year Blood War versions of the main cast."

He sent me pics of him factory resetting it. I asked him if the disc drive worked and he assured me it did. When I met this dude he was cool. Talked about anime, Team Four Star, games. Did not strike me as the type of guy who would do someone dirty.

Well he did. The disc drive doesn't work and he deleted his profile. I went out and bought Dark souls 3 at my local Walmart. I already had a real crap day. I just wanted to chill and play some PlayStation. I was about to order some exclusives too later tonight. So now I'm out $20, I can only buy digitally, and I'm feeling like a sucker. 

Be mindful who you buy from. Make sure you can test it. If you buy on here, make sure you're using goods and services so you are protected. My first Sony Console in three year and the experience is ruined from someone who straight lied to my face. Who knew what they were doing. This one hurts. I feel seriously taken advantage of, hopeless I can't do anything about it, and it makes my faith in humanity that much harder. Don't be a fool like I was."

PS4,uzhquv,I‚Äôm 2 dollars short does anybody know a way to discount it?,.
PS4,uzc40t,Which gameplay loop is most important to you?,"Real quick for those who might not know:

""Gameplay loops"" are often broken down into 3 Tiers - primary, secondary, and tertiary. 

Primary = moment-to-moment gameplay, e.g. combat and transversal/exploration systems, resource gathering and mgmt, stealth, etc. 

Secondary = goals that help give purpose to or provide a means to justify the primary loop, e.g. base building, level completion, exploration of new biomes/areas, skill trees, etc.

Tertiary = the overall context and purpose for the other two loops; usually a story or clear long term goal, such as collecting all of something (stars in Mario) or getting a high score

Not *every* game includes all 3 tiers, but a great many modern games do. And if any 1 of them is missing and it's not a dealbreaker for you, clearly that's the weak link for assuring your engagement and enjoyment. 

Personally, I've stopped putting up with average-to-subpar primary loops just so I cam get through a story, even if I'm interested to know what happens next. 

Meanwhile, I'll put up with any bogus tertiary loop if I like the primary loop enough. Examples include Destiny 2, DOOM, MGSV, and Arkham Knight. But if a game's got a lot of padding in the second loop, with skill trees that have a bunch of junk options, or a bunch of collectables that don't affect the primary or tertiary loops hardly at all (looking at you Naughty Dog), I'll make it a point to finish the game faster before the primary loop overstays its welcome. 

What about you all? I feel like your favorite genre largely informs your answer, but there's a lot of variety out there so what do I know."
PS4,uzayp3,PS4 Online Status and Privacy Settings,"Other privacy settings like messaging gives
You a option of ‚Äúno one‚Äù while there isn‚Äôt that option for online status. Why is that? 

I just feel like Sony PlayStation features in general are not good. If I log in as offline, my friends always know I‚Äôm online. I feel like notify me when friend is online supersedes everything. 

Sometimes you just want to chill and build and can‚Äôt bc everyone knows your online and is like what‚Äôs up? 

Does Sony not do focus groups? I‚Äôm not complaining I‚Äôm just kinda lol at how bad their ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù are. More like ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. 

Probably will fall in deaf ears but it‚Äôs
Frustrating."

[https://www.rewards.sony.com/](https://www.rewards.sony.com/)

I must have signed up for it at some point because when I came across the Sony Rewards website I was like, ""Well that's a scam"". But I looked into it further and found it wasn't fake. It's directly linked to Playstation so I logged in with my Playstation credentials and sure enough, I was getting points every time I bought something off the Playstation Store for like, years now.  The rewards program *IS* linked to having a Sony-branded Credit Card, but you also get points for buying stuff off the store from your Playstation, because I definitely don't have a Sony Credit Card.

So just a heads up to anyone who might have signed up and forgot. I decided to post this on here because when checking the legitimacy of the rewards programs a lot of people on forums assumed it was fake but, never looked into it.

Investigate for yourself, and go get some gift cards and buy a new game today. The End."

PS4,uwf0ji,Resident evil 2 Remake makes my fan to go brrr.,"So on January 2021 I replaced thermal paste and thermal pads for my PS4 Slim, replaced factory internal HDD with WD Blue SSD. It‚Äôs always quiet when I‚Äôm playing games. Sometimes the fan will run noticeably audible in intense scenes of some demanding games after hours of gameplay, it will always fluctuate depending on the scene, but nothing like in Resident Evil 2. Ive decided to go through RE2-3 remakes couple days ago, I have disc versions.

As soon as I load my save file and go in to gameplay, the fan of the console just constantly runs loud, very noticeable. It doesn‚Äôt change its speed, just constantly high. Not on highest RPMs but I never heard my console to take off like that before. As soon as I exit the game and close it, the fan would subside, even though I just launched RE2R and loaded my save after console startup.

I opened up my console to see maybe there is some dust accumulated, but there is none, radiator is fine. Console located at the space with a lot of airflow.

I assume it‚Äôs just RE Engine and a game itself that pushes console APU, fan sensor recognize the load and launch Fan on medium-high RPMs.

I played RE2 for 5 hours now, never got any overheating messages, console pushes warm/hot air from the exhaust as it should, it‚Äôs just a fan that runs very audible. Console is warm to the touch, which is normal. No Throttling and frame drops, game actually runs surprisingly well and looks amazing with HDR enabled.

I just want to ask anyone who played this game on their PS4, did you encountered same issue? I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable for me to go through Thermal paste replacement and pads after such short timeframe only because of this game. I expect at-least 4 years of its thermal interface to work properly, even though Arctic claim to have 8 years of high efficiency for their mx-4 thermal paste."

He wants the game back and is offering $80 for it because it has ""sentimental value"" with his girlfriend. I agree and he agrees to come. He changes his mind and demands I gave it back because I ""Stole"" the game. He demands I go to him and give him the game with a written letter of apology. Call me a asshole for wanting the money, but I saw an opportunity and took it. Sorry that I'm a terrible human being. Anyway, I panick and block him. Please be kind and give me some advice.

PS4,uv4b7m,wrongfully banned!,"Hi guys im pretty new here (to both¬†r/ps4¬†and reddit itself).

So some backstory i have had a ps4 for over 5 years now. I invested thousands of dollars on it and have been very loyal to the playstation brand. The whole incident started back in january 2022, ""Locker reveal"" videos in fortnite were becoming very viral on youtube so i decided to give it a shot. I made a video and uploaded it and it got over 3,000 views which isnt much but it was my most popular video on my channel, i say was because i had to delete it (you'll see why).

A few weeks after i uploaded the video (18th of february to be exact) i turned on my playstation and saw the ""sign in to playstation network to use the online features"" error. As any normal person would i thought it was a regular software update, but then i checked my email and the last email i had got said ""sign in id changed"" this was not the first time my account had been compromised so i knew exactly what to do. I contacted support and within an hour i had my account back, i noticed the ""hacker"" had made himself at home because he removed like 50 of my friends and added a lot of his and was bragging about how he ""nagged some rich kids account after seeing it on a youtube video"" (mind you im not rich). After seeing this i instantly changed the youtube video's privacy to private so no one else could see it.

The very next day though the ""hacker"" hacked it again. Unfortunately this time though when i contacted support they had other plans... they said my account had been locked and no changes could be made to it for 7 days. After the said time i contacted them again and the process was simple enough you know date of creation ps4 serial number etc and i got it back.

This time though i decided to have a chat with his friends. I asked them who he was and no one replied except for this one guy ""anxoss-"" (that was his psn online id) he said he is a (please excuse my language here) A 14 year old √üƒ∑ ≈à√• who lives in michigan. I was shocked to see his language but i continued and asked him to keep it pg. He showed me his face (which i am 100% sure was fake and just a african american child's photo from google) i decided to block te guy and tell my best friend who was messaging me through ps messages why i unfriended her, but before i could i saw there was another friend of mine who had said ""i am reporting you"" as the last message. I decided to check it out amd shockingly the last words on there from my account (which the hacker wrote) were the ones i mentioned above. The conversation went something like; shut the fk up you na go k*l yourself. I saw this i freaked out because he said im reporting you.

This is where my mistake comes in because then and there i should have contacted psn support and told them all about this, but i decided not to.

The very next day when i logged on it read "" your account has beed permanently suspended due to violence of playstation's code of conduct"".

None of you have any idea how much heart rapidly started beating, i though i was having a heart attack.

I contacted support (this time via call) and fully explained myself as to how the ""hacker"" used hate speech and tge guy who he used it on is a friend of mine, but to no remorse, because the only answer i got from support was ""our team makes thorough checks before banning a players account so this desicion is irreversible, we suggest you create a new account to start playing again"".

This was none of my fault. One stupid video to try to get viral landed my account getting banned. 5 years of grinding of 10,000 hours of play and almost 14,000 usd in expenses all down the drain.

If there is anyone that knows a solution to this please do let me know please üôè. Its not that i lost my money and progress i feel like i lost a piece of myself."

I expected this to happen but, I really want to experience PlayStation exclusives like Spiderman and Ghost of Tsushima.

PS4,uv1eso,Ps4 ejecting discs,Long story short I bought a refurbished ps4 yesterday from GameStop and bought some games alongside it. I took it home and got it all set up and I‚Äôve tried every disc and they all keep getting thrown up (ejected) after about 3-5 minutes of play. The ps4 tells me something about not recognizing the disc and to clean it but I‚Äôve tried it already multiple times. I‚Äôve tried multiple discs and multiple methods but nothing works. I‚Äôve also restarted it and that hasn‚Äôt worked either. Idk if to return it or if there‚Äôs a way to fix this or idk

I don't care about the free games most of them are garbage hey most of you may like paying and can always afford it I mean that's like me paying to just wake up in the morning makes no sense ps3 had plus but it didn't stop you from going online so say if you want a ps4 right you go out and buy It , you buy the first game with it and then turn around and buy ps plus let alone digital ps4 games and then there's in game store currency which isn't a problem it just adds up what you have to pay if you want to be online free go to PC other wise in my opinion you're giving rich people money it's worse if you're an online gamer I'm sure they know people who have bills to pay why the hell are they forcing you to pay to play online it's nothing but money snatching i need an explanation oh BTW their thinking of bumping the subscription too figured I'd throw that out their the membership is just another bill added to you're total you're already paying you're gas and light bill phone bill and now a ps plus bill lmao"

PS4,uttbpk,Just imagine that the next gta will be released for 8th gen consoles What Are Your Expectations for the next gta game ?,"With the success of GTA 5, Rockstar Games have become synonymous with amazing story telling.

Players expect GTA 6 to be able to satisfy their need for a compelling storyline. Rockstar has made iconic games like GTA San Andreas and even GTA 4, which have changed the way players look at games.

They have given games more of a movie-like feeling where the players get to play through a movie and fans want a heightened experience of the same in GTA 6.

Players are done with pre-assigned protagonists in GTA. With the release of Cyberpunk 2077, players saw a new approach to having a life path in the game.

Players get to enjoy a diverse gaming experience by choosing different life paths, making each choice different based on what life path they choose at the beginning. Players would love to see GTA have such a system in GTA 6 as it lets players pick a unique start to their personalized story.

And my other expectations are the revisiting the old map option and also telling the story of the old gta protagonists and hopefully a new combat system

For a button that is exponentially larger than any others on the DS4, it‚Äôs a bit sad how underutilized the track pad has been. 
It takes up so much real estate, and ends up usually being a map shortcut, if anything at all. What are some games that actually used the pad in interesting ways?

Risk of Rain let you use it like a mouse, to hover over items on your HUD that would bring up info about them. I always thought this would be a good general use for it, but I barely ever see it.  
Dreadnaught uses its ‚Äúswipe‚Äù functions to quickly divert power to shields/weapons etc for each direction. A useful shortcut at least.
Concrete Genie and Tearaway both use the trackpad to make designs in game I believe, cant quite recall if worked really well or not."

I had no idea that the game belongs to the dark souls universe and after dying for 30 minutes I put it aside. A while later I bought Sekiro (again not informing myself properly) and after 2 hours of really struggling I put it aside. Now you are thinking what a noob.... Well I am gaming now for more than 25 years and would consider myself at least average but have mainly played shooter and sports games on both PC and console. Anyways, when Elden Ring was released I couldn't hold back and bought. Absolutely loving it and in the meantime also understood how to play the game. This brings me back to my question, which dark souls should I buy and play? Is there one specifically that is worth it on PS4 and that still holds up nicely after years of release? Of course I will try to get back into Sekiro and Bloodbourne as well. Thanks"

PS4,ursbru,Accessing files from a different HDD," Hey everyone! I still have the HDD from my old PS4 that I had since 2015 and I sold in the 2nd half of 2019 since it was broken. Is there any way to access the files on that HDD by installing it on a different PS4? I especially want to see my old screen shoots and screen recordings, just for the sake of nostalgia. I tried booting a PS4 with this HDD installed but it wanted me to reinstall the system from a USB stick, would all the files get erased if I do that? What's the best way of getting to those files?"

My sisters ex boyfriend ‚Äúgave‚Äù me his extra ps4 a few months back before they split up. Now he‚Äôs texting me saying he wants it back even though he gave it to me. This is the first time he‚Äôs said anything to me in months and it‚Äôs about his old ps4. Should i give it back and be nice or what should i do? I hardly ever use the ps4 but he did give it to me. Dosent that technically make me the rightful owner? And he would have to pay me to get it back? This guy is a pos btw, my family took him on vacations and we‚Äôve always paid for anything while he was living with us and he can‚Äôt even help my sister raise their kid. He never watches his kid or provides anything for him or my sister to help out. He claims he dosent have time for his own kid because he ‚Äúhas school, works out everyday, and works at walmart‚Äù. But he has time to hit me up for his ps4 that he‚Äôll probably sell and buy drugs with. What should i do?"
PS4,urr9z3,gioteck controller,does any one have experience with these? and are they worth buying?
PS4,urr9qp,Does anyone feel this way too while playing story based games ?,"Hey guys, 
Before I start, I want to give some insight about me in case that helps. 
I‚Äôm a 27 years old guy, I love video games, I love collecting steelbooks, collector‚Äôs edition version of games, figures, etc.. 
I always buy the latest consoles, currently I have a PS5 and Xbox S/X along with the Oled Switch. 
My problem is I can‚Äôt start playing a new game unless I am 100% sure that nothing is gonna come up to interrupt the gaming session, this only applies to story and adventure based games such as (Horizon zero dawn, Final fantasy, ghost of Tsushima etc..). If a certain thing happened during the day I play such a game, I would stop playing it for like a week or a month, then find it hard to go back to where I left off, so I will have to restart the whole game to catch up and remember the things I forgot, even if I only left for two or three days I will still do the same thing and restart the game all over again just to be able to follow up, and and story keeps happening over and over again with every game I buy or try to play. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my anxiety, or is it because I‚Äôm suffering from severe depression although I know that gaming is the only thing that gives me some relief, but being hesitant to play a certain game that I love just because I‚Äôm worried something he‚Äôs gonna show up and will force me to stop playing and restart the game later on after a week or two or three or a month. For example I am yet to play God of war, assassin‚Äòs creed Valhalla, Control, etc although these games were released long time ago. And this thing is really bothering me because every time I go back to play a game I left for a week or two I end up dumping the whole game just because I forgot the plot and I don‚Äôt wanna restart the whole game all over again. 

Does anyone else suffer from the same issue, or is it just me? 
Please share your thoughts maybe it can help me, since I‚Äôm slowly starting to feel that even the only thing that used to give me some relief (Gaming) has been making me super anxious for the last couple of years because of the issue I‚Äôve mentioned before. 

This is my first time ever writing on Reddit, so please no need to be rude or troll me regarding this matter, and English is not my first language so there might be a lot of grammar mistakes. 

Thank you"

I was sort of hoping they would atleast TRY to revamp their classic offering but it seems the classic games is exactly what they already were offering already.

I can tell because for some weird reason they only ever had Resistance 3 and not resistance 1 and 2. 

Now that they finally released the list of classic games yet again it only shows Resistance 3....

Have they made any attempt in updating the classic catalogue? It seems to be the exact same...unless Im missing something here?

Why is there such a huge gap in their classics catalogue?"

PS4,urb9vk,Alternate d pad location,"I‚Äôve been playing several games recent where the d pad might be needed while using the left stick to move around, namely AC Odyssey or Horizon Zero Dawn /Forbidden west. 

For example I‚Äôve found myself several times frantically running from a machine while searching through my pack trying to scroll across to the health potions or hit up for healing in the horizon games. Or in AC odyssey I‚Äôve found it annoying to have to stop every time I use the pulse to search ability. 

The thing is, the only way I‚Äôve found to do that while still moving around is to twist my left hand so I can use the inside of my pointer finger to tab up or to the side with the d pad while running away with the joystick. Seems inconvenient considering how often you need to dodge while recovering: letting go of the ‚Äúlook‚Äù stick is fine, but stopping completely while trying to locate an item is a bit different. the control combos for games are getting more and more nuanced with each Gen of console, with combo buttons for varying attacks instead of just spamming the square button or right trigger, and that seems to be a huge limitation since the left needs to almost be constantly used to move.

I was wondering if it was possible to have a controller with either the primary D pad or a secondary d pad on the back of the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù of the controller for your middle or ring finger to accessI mean 90 percent of the time my fingers are just sitting there anyways, as my hands are big enough that I don‚Äôt need all 3 other fingers for the grip, so my middle finger is kind of just resting across the bridge anyways. And it‚Äôs not like people ever look at the controller while they‚Äôre playing anyways, and fine movement won‚Äôt be exactly needed for a basic d pad you use sparingly. Maybe for weapon switches, or to allow more combinations of attacks. 

Curious whether people have thoughts on this concept, or have found other solutions for this type of problem."

I also recently played the Guardians of the Galaxy game and thought it was AWESOME for what it was.

I have also tried Outer Worlds, and was unimpressed with that as well and was just massively underwhelmed. I tried death stranding but was also let down, it was visually stunning but the gameplay was just so damn slow. I was looking forward to Cyberpunk, but after all the issues and it seems like the fixes theyve implemented are more for ps5 than ps4 so Im not sure about that. All in all, Im just looking to find a new game that will grab my interest, thats mostly pretty, has alot to do (not a need but like, Horizon? Horizon had a good amount to do), and has a decently gripping story. Am I out of luck? Am I asking too much? Anyone have any recommendations on a game thatll makes life worth living for a bit?"

PS4,uq272r,"Legit Check ""Used"" PS4 Controller","Hey guys, about a month ago I bought a DS4 for around 25 USD (converted from my currency) from a site equivalent with ebay.

I don't actually own an PS4, I'm just playing on PC using DS4Windows.  Out of curiousity I'd like to know if this controller is legit or not. 

Good news:  
\- I tried [gamepad-tester.com](https://gamepad-tester.com) on both my laptop and phone, showing up as:

    Sony PS4 Dualshock Wireless Controller (STANDARD GAMEPAD Vendor: 054c Product: 09cc)

\- Buttons work and feel great

\- Battery lasts a whole day of playing

\- Headphone jack works stereo and sounds good 

&gt;*I don't use the headphone jack often but I just tested it because I heard a lot of people complaining about fakes having bad crappy audio*

\- Pairs pretty fast

\- Doesn't take too long to charge

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I would think it's **legit**:

\- The seller had a lot of products on her page (not just controllers) and the selling page was also promoted (*promoted meaning the the seller payed a monthly subscription and when a user types ""PS4 Controller"" in the search bar the seller's page will show up in the top items*).  I asked her charging the controller for me to test it when it arrives at my house. (In my country there's an option to check the packages and the courier will wait patiently watching you decide whether or not you're happy with the product delivered, I was happy seeing the controller connected bluetooth to my phone and working fine so I accepted the parcel and gave the money to the courier).

\- On the official **About DS4Windows** page it says that complete replicas of the ds4 just **may** work, meaning that this is either a legit controller or a perfect replica.

Reasons I have my doubts:

Well, the thing is that I never tried opening a DS4 controller until now and I have zero knowledge of legit checking the internals. Maybe someone more experienced with this stuff could tell me:

\-Risk of rain 2: Apparently a great roguelike. Seems like it'd be great if I could convince my friend to get it. I've heard that it's buggy on console though. As far as Roguelites go, I'm not really enjoying Hades, but Slay the Spire is fantastic

\-Rainworld: Looks very interesting and unique. But I've also heard it's very frustrating

\-Celeste: Apparently a great game. Not sure I'd enjoy the story that much since I've been fortunate enough to never suffer from anxiety/depression, and the story seems to be presented as one of the main selling points"

PS4,uodkn1,any fun racing game for PS4?,"Back in late 90' I loved playing n4s 2 and hot pursuit with my best friend (all day and night, we were insane), but ok that's unplayable today. The last fun racing game I played was n4s most wanted on PS3, first time played all night, finished and platinumed.

 Since then not many interesting games. I have dirt rally, dirt 2.0, dirt 5, gt sport, ride 3, wipeout Omega, onrush, all n4s except heat, tried Payback today and didn't liked it.

I'm interested in grid legends (however, Gran Turismo was always nice cars but kinda boring so I'm not sure about gt7) but I'll wait until price is under 20$. If I was sure I'll play long i would pay full price.

I love rally in real life but unfortunately PS4 games are kinda boring. Never was a fun of F1, but heard they're good games, tried some on PS3 but couldn't get into it.

Ride 3 is good game (hard too) but since I'm riding motorcycles in real life I can't help but chuckle, handling is just fake and wrong so I deleted.

I'm not sure about assetto Corsa, afraid it's not gonna be fun.

Should I give gt sport another try?  Or any suggestion about another game?"

PS4,uoasw3,Don't casual gamers have space anymore in the gaming community?,"It's been a while since I always see people on the internet saying that if you don't play on PC you aren't a gamer or aren't not enjoying videogames on the right way, or that consoles are a waste of money and time etc, and the same shit as usual.

Why did playing on a console become so wrong for the gaming community? I usually only use this sub, the PS5 sub, and r/truegaming to talk about videogame because on other subs it's always so difficult to have a nice talking after you say that you play and like to play on a console.

I'm 23 years old, I got a job, a gf who I love, videogames aren't anymore the most important thing in my life. I'm not a kid or a teenager who can spend all day playing video games. I'm now an average worker who just wants to relax on my couch after a long day of work and go out with my gf at the weekends. I don't even play online anymore (except for some casual mobile games with my gf)

People need to chill more. Videogames are just a fun way of entertainment, you don't always need to buy a gaming pc to play everything with the max specs possible or fill your game with mods. I mean, of course, I like those things, but I don't really care that much to invest all my money on a gaming pc. I don't have that much free time to spend hours modding a game or playing online the entire day.

There's still life out there and it seems people don't know that anymore and think everyone needs to be a hardcore gamer if they like to play without any commitment. I still have my Switch and my PS5 and I'm happy with that, and while consoles are still a thing, I'll keep buying them."
PS4,uo8ui2,Cool open-world games,"I'm looking for a new game that's playable on the ps4. My favourite games are open world games that have interesting character development and storyline, and beautiful scenery I can escape to (whether that is sweeping landscapes or post apocalyptic cities taken over by nature). I like exploring, collecting loot, some puzzles (but not essential) and some fighting, be it shooting or slashing. I'm not good at remembering lots of fighting combos though, and I don't like first person shooters like Call of Duty. 

My favourite game ever is Red Dead Redemption 2 ( not in first person mode) because of excellent characters that I cared about, storyline, beautiful scenery, lovely horsey, seemingly endless places to explore and things to do and collect, the astounding level of detail and choices, and lots of other reasons. 

Other games I love in order are The Last of Us 2, The Last of Us, Journey, The Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West games. 

I'm coming to the end of my current game and need your advice. It would really help me (only if you have time) if you could say why it/they might be the game(s) for me. Thank you so much in advance,¬† I will look into every idea."

Ive got it down to a top 5 in no particular order‚Ä¶ 

-The Last Guardian; This is probably all me, being so hyped about finally playing the successor to Ico and SotC. The game can be frustrating, but it hit me in the feels.
-Kingdom Come; I did not expect to spend 100hrs playing this, but the story and setting were so immersive, and the mechanics alluringly obtuse.
-No Mans Sky; I was not on board when the hype train crashed, and only started playing about a year after release with no expectations. Exploring its universe was fascinating, I thought.
-Nidhogg; As simple as this game looks, it had our whole living room cheering and booing, during tense back and forth showdowns. Hosted a few local tournaments even, in the beforetimes.
-Apex Legends; I don‚Äôt play online often, but I got into this with a small crew when it dropped and it was our entry into battle royales‚Ä¶ We eventually got some team wins together and it was exhilarating, but I don‚Äôt think any other game has made me as tense or anxious.

Yeah, he's getting a good lesson out of this, but I can teach him that in other ways. We're just trying to have fun during our game time, and we have been up until this point where now it feels like work.

All the colors look washed out and the frame rate is noticeably lower than what I would get through the native TV streaming opinions. The color issue can be mitigated with the TV settings but I haven't found a way to deal with the frame rate problem. Is there a setting on the PS4 I need to change? The only video setting I've found is for 1080p at 24Hz and that is just a toggle switch that makes no noticeable difference. The native refresh rate of my TV is 60Hz and it is a 4k UHD display. It is old at this point. LG has stopped putting out firmware updates for it. Is there anything I can do here?

We would constantly get the ""unexpected error occurred when joining the group"" error

  
Well, thankfully one of the group members works in IT/networking and suggested it might be the router causing an issue.  It was a long shot, but worth testing.

So, I disconnected my PS5 from the router and connected it directly to the modem, and what do you know! It worked perfectly!  I could host and join groups with no problem!

&amp;#x200B;

So, if you are constantly getting this error, please look up how to set up port forwarding on your router.  It will entirely resolve this issue for Midgard, and possibly resolve some other issues you may have had online as well

Here is a link to learn how to do this: [https://portforward.com/playstation-4/](https://portforward.com/playstation-4/)

So if you can find Guardians for a decent price somewhere, you should give it a shot. It really is a lot of fun."

PS4,unebfa,My PS4 Pro has gradually become more unstable lately and it's driving me nuts. Anyone else?,"When I'm browsing games on the PS4 Store - with nothing else open - the Media tab won't even load properly most of the time.

If I want to look at screenshots of the game (that thumbnails prove the existence of), they won't show in full screen.

Or when I'm scrolling, it'll randomly freeze up. Then I get a ""Please wait"" sign, and it throws me right back to the top of whatever collection I was looking at, which can easily be hundreds of titles.

That happened **FIVE TIMES** today when I was just scrolling through the Deals.

When I'm on YouTube, the video and audio can freeze. Then, the PS4 revs up like it's rebooting or recovering from a crash (you know the sound). Home screen music starts playing... except I'm still stuck on YouTube with the frozen video and unable to control it.

Holding the power button down does nothing, so I have to unplug the console from the wall and plug it back in.

PS4,une069,Headphones microphone does not work on ps4,"Hello!

I have Steelseries Siberia 800 headset which is wireless. They work without any issues on my PC.
1.5 years ago I used them on my ps4 and they worked there as well without any issues.

I wanted to get back to ps4 gaming but for some reason my microphone will not work. I'm using them daily on my PC and there are no issues.

In ps4 it even says in my audio settings that microphoned are set to the siberia headset but no audio comes out of them. I can hear fine I just cannot talk to anyone.

I'm really confused as to why it's not working, anyone got a clue?

TL;DR: I'm using Steelseries Siberia 800 wireless headset. Used to work on ps4 around 1.5 years ago. Now I can only get sound but my microphone will not be picked up. (Still works perfectly on PC)"

In other words, I exxegerated and made it worse than it is, however I actually think it is a terrible game. Long story short, they'll probably say no or ignore it but will ANYTHING happen because I exxegerated or simply tried to request a refund for a game which I already played?

She did all the exploration and almost got all the way to the first ending (all I did was beat all the bosses for her as she isn‚Äôt into intense combat).

Although she isn‚Äôt into a fixation on combat (she got to level 30 and discovered a really large part of the map just by traversing, while never beating Morgitt in Elden Ring), she does like to have at least some amount of combat, as platform only games bore her rather quickly (she didn‚Äôt enjoy Celeste, although I thought it‚Äôd fit her tastes perfectly.)

PS4,un5u8p,"My fellow sports games fans, which of the upcoming soccer games are you most excited for and why?","So, by now, we know that we are entering a pretty wild and weird time for fans of the beautiful game. For years now, soccer games have been almost exclusively just FIFA and PES. Both required the yearly $60ish investment for mostly a roster update and maybe a couple new features and gameplay upgrades.

In the (hopefully near) future, we the gamers will have at least 5 new games to choose from! Those games will be EA Sports FC, FIFA's rival to EASFC, eFootball, UFL and GOALS. The latter 3 are/will be free to play which I assume that EASFC and its rival will continue to do yearly releases at a $60ish price point.

Personally, I've already given up on FIFA, so EASFC and it's rival aren't for me. I'm excited to see where these other companies choose to take the idea of a soccer game. It will be very interesting to see what sort of features, animations, game modes, etc get included in order to give each game its own unique feel.

eFootball is already available for free and while it's definitely rough around the edges (and there honestly isn't very much content right now) it's a nice change of pace from what FIFA is. Over time I'm sure it'll get even better to compete with FIFA, at least in the short term.

All that being said, I just wanted to find out which of these y'all are most excited for. For me, it's GOALS! On paper, they seem to have a ridiculously cool concept and I think if they manage to pull it off and simultaneously deliver a game that feels satisfying to play, then they'll run away with the market. If you haven't already, definitely check them out to see what sort of ideas they're wanting to bring to the table! Share your thoughts on how you think the soccer game landscape will change in the coming months/years!

P.S. yes, I also posted this in the ps5 subreddit but I really wanted to hear what y'all have to say!"

PS4,umxx4h,PS4 Pro not outputting from capture card,"So I bought a capture card to record some videos with my ps4 pro and something very odd is happening.

So I connect the USB from the card to the pc and the ps4 hdmi cable to input and finally hook a hdmi from the output of the card to my display. I then open obs and it works I can see and hear my ps4 through obs. However when I go to switch the input on the display to the capture card it shows no signal.

I've googled the problem and it seems the way to fix it is to turn off HDCP so I do that and the display still shows no signal but obs still has video of the system. I restarted the system and also have had the same result.

I know the card works because it does what it is supposed to do with my ps3 and ps2.

Anyone have any ideas?"

Can someone please tell me why, after getting called racial and homophobic slurs in a game (You already know it's GTA), leaving said game only to get a direct message from the same person calling me, yet again racist and homophobic slurs, I responded by calling them a ""little B*tch "" I get suspended for 3 days? This mf gets away with saying the nastiest shit and I get locked out.



Side note: why tf can PlayStation lock us out of games we already own and paid for? Isn't that..idk like stealing? 

And speaking of stealing. About a year ago someone got into my account, bought a bunch of games and changed the password. After a horrendous time getting my account back a few months later I get locked out again because PlayStation didn't acknowledge that I wasn't the one that bought the games. So once again I'm having to contact my bank, going through three different committees of review from PlayStation, All for them to say oops. They did absolutely nothing to help bring justice or catch the culprit. So I bet you that MF is still out there doing the same shit.

PS4,umbgte,Sword and Fairy 7 coming to PS4 in 2022, 
PS4,umb798,Ghost of Tsushima (Caution Spoilers),"Fist I would like to say this is one of the best games I have played in awhile.  
There are a few things that irritate me in this game first of all the wild bores they will just disappear once you kill or severely injure one its like once you turn the camera angle away from them and turn back they are just gone and this is in a wide open field.   
Another thing I noticed is further you get along in the game the more glitches that happen.  
One of the most irritating glitches is when fighting (This only happens at random and stated halfway through act II) you cant hit crap you face the enemy swing your sword and you swing and miss because your character moved to the right or left to the enemy. This gets frustrating when you are dealing with multiples of enemies.  
Another bug is with the blow darts if you are standing above the enemy they will not work or if you are too far away but it shows them hitting their target.  
the best glitch I ran into was one of the enemies got stuck on stone stairs and was constantly shooting you with the hand cannon but when you ran up to him to hit him your sword just went right through him like he wasn't even there. when I threw a sticky bomb at him it just dropped off him and rolled but luckily when it went off it was still close to him and killed him.  
Another cool glitch is in the ocean if you jump just before you swim you will slide across the water for a couple of seconds before falling into the water 

Now the biggest screw up by the devs is iki island if you play it late in the game (Like I am) your character calls your horse by your dead horses name     
I may sound like I am raging on this game but honestly I give it a 10/10 I am an old school gamer so I don't expect games to be perfect and I recommend this game to all my friends."

PS4,um0bas,Dilemma about my psn account,"I made my psn account in 2010, back then my country didn't have psn service, so I had to pick another region, I don't remember why, but I picked UK, over the years the prices in the uk store kept increasing, eventually I made a usa alt account, for which I bought psn + and games, and shared them with my main uk psn, I've been playing like that until now.

the problem is that with ps5 and sony deciding to make their services more strict, for example removing the ability to transfer save files to an external drive, and cloud services being strict to the psn + user only, it's starting to give me trouble, if my uk main doesn't have a psn +, I won't be able to save any game files.

on the other hand, psn + and games in general cost much less in the usa store, to the point that even if I get a uk psn +, it won't be worth buying any games there, because usa prices will still be cheaper. 

it comes down to either discarding 10 years of progress and trophies and quitting my main uk account and having to start over, or pay more for psn + and games on the uk main account, while I can pay less for the same thing on the usa alt. 

what would you guys do? I'm really not sure, dumping 10 years of progress and starting fresh is quite brutal."

PS4,ulr7os,I might just pick up a PS4 this summer.,"I know, the PS5 is out already, but I missed the boat with the PS4.  Other than Tales of Graces the last Playstation console I played was PS2, which I loved (beat about a dozen and a half ps2 RPGs).  I do have a switch (Ni No Kuni 1/2, Tales of Vesperia, XC 1/2)

I am thinking FF15, Tales of Berseria, Zesteria, Ys 9, and DQ11 are good places to start for the system. Maybe Nier. The Trails games were too slow and too dialogue-heavy for me (I beat one and played one other PSP Trails game).  I am still in wait-and-see mode for FF7R.  I wish I could play FF13 (12 was the last FF I played) but it seems that it will always be just PS3 and eternal sonata just ps3/xbox).

Any other games similar to what I want to get or just Jrpgs?  Honestly, Dark Souls/ Elden ring doesn't appeal to me, I think my personality type would get too frustrated with those games, I don't have the time or patience I think.

I loved the new worlds and the Uncharted-like exploration, Metroidvania elements, even the Sekiro-like combat was fairly satisfying. (Not as good as Sekiro, but more than serviceable.) I was close to the end of the game, but decided to take a long break. 

Tonight I decided to finish, and boy the climax and end of this game did not disappoint. That final area was great, and the final boss. &gt;!Then Darth Vader showing up and being a terrifying badass.!&lt; Oh man. This game desperately deserves a sequel.

Anyway, I started playing TLOU a couple months ago and realized the same bird song is in the game, which only made me love this game even more. I don‚Äôt know what kind of bird is singing though and I need to know, so if you know please let me know so we can both know. üòÖ

I asked an employee and he said it was on the check where there were the instructions.
So i'm wondering why did sony as it just seems harder,i mean you anyway had to buy it in order to get the transparent box opened by the cash reguster guy and also most people just throw the check and probably lose the expensive ps plus.

So do you think they will change it and why did they really change it into the first place?"

You don't have to read this that's just what happened to me like 2 years ago when ps5 was announced :
Everything was normal and my ps4 was doing great until it suddenly became so loud and slow, after a while it became so laggy and turn off by itself until it didn't turn on anymore, I initialized it 3 or 4 times but it didn't work,
 So I got another ps4 and everything was good for a while until the ps4 couldn't open again, but this time I initialized it and worked for 2-3 weeks until I couldn't open some games and the next day I couldn't open any game so I initialized it again and it worked, but after 2 days the problems came back with new problems, and everytime I open the ps4 it tells me that the ps4 cannot open and that I have to reinstall the system software but I press cancel and it worked everytime, but today it didn't work and here am I initializing it again, everything is going great till now but I know the problems will come back."

PS4,uhsire,Got shitfaced and pulled apart my ps4,"So after a long day, and a few more beers than necessary, I thought it would be a good idea to pull apart my PS4. I have a launch issue one that was one of the first large purchases I ever made with my own money. I bought it in high-school, and she's still with me today.

Last few months I noticed she sounded like an asthmatic bull whenever I played a more graphically demanding game. Quite frankly, it scared me. I thought she was on her way out. 

Last night, she finally shit out on me as I was coming around the last lap of Monaco in F12021. I had staged a herculean comeback from p15, both max and bottas crashed out, and i was set to take the lead in the constructors. I'm fuckin pissed, and a few buds deep, so i fire my controller at the console as any reasonable human being would do.

So I stand up and spike my ps4 with my controller, which breaks off the glossy part of the system exposing the whole hard drive area (never knew you could remove that so easily). Wherein, I see what must be pounds of dust. All of a sudden, my mind flashes back to my childhood days when me and my dad would take apart our Playstation and clean out the vents when the system would get ""fuckey"".

Realizing this just became a much larger job, I go for the whiskey and set to it. So about three doubles, three stripped security screws, and countless frustrated expletives screamed drunkenly at youtuber MODDED HARDWARE I mange to take apart, clean out, and put back together my beloved childhood friend.

And guess what? She runs like a dream! Silent as a physically disciplined child. 

Moral of the story? When something fucks with you, get drunk and throw shit at it. Learned that from Sesame Street."

PS4,uhk6vr,Share Play is the coolest thing since sliced bread,"I stumbled on this feature a few weeks ago and it is beyond cool.

If you're like me and haven't heard of this (I only got a PS in November) this is what it is

&gt;It allows you to invite a visitor to view your screen for up to 60 minutes a session. Share Play allows you to hand over your controller to a visitor so they can play instead. You can also invite your visitor to play a local multiplayer session over the internet, even if the game doesn't support online multiplayer. The visitor doesn't need to own the game to use Share Play.

I have a friend who's really bad at video games but likes them anyway. If you give him any sort of FPS game, he's what I call a walk-then-look player; he can't really operate both analog sticks at the same time. 

So despite that, he still just wants to hang out with me and another of our friends who I play with regularly, so I'll share my screen with him while our other friend and I play CoD or The Forest or something and he can be included. Or one time he shared his screen with me and I helped him out with Little Nightmares.

I haven't tried out the other two features of Share Play yet but I'm real curious.

Anyway, i know I'm very late to the party but I just think this is a wildly cool feature and if anyone else didn't know about it, well, now you do!"
PS4,uhjabz,Trek to Yomi | Launch Trailer, 
PS4,uhh1l7,"""Hold L3 to sprint"" needs to be done away with - for ALL games","I'm playing through HFW right now - and loving it - but I'm experiencing the same quality of life problem I did when I played HZD, Nier: Automota, and every other fast-paced action game (3rd person, FPS, doesn't matter) and that is A REALLY SORE THUMB.

Sometimes battles go on for 10 or 15mins+ and during or by the end of them my thumb gets so damn sore from having to constantly press down on the left joystick while also frantically moving in all directions. 

Why can't sprinting simply be incorporated into ""full"" analog control? Is there a design or tech reason I'm not aware of? Is there a button mapping setting I missed? Or has this been standard for so long we just haven't questioned it?"

PS4,ugzqec,What are some good ways to prevent stick drift?,"I'll be honest, i'm mostly an Xbox player as that's what I was introduced to at a young age and I just stuck with it. I only bring this up because naturally i'll notice some controller differences and one that I often find an issue with on PS is stick drift. I'm not overly aggresive when playing games, nor do I feel like I play PS enough for the sticks to wear out as quick as they do. I've been through 3 or 4 controllers in like a year and a half, I even have the knowledge to open them up and clean inside of those green squares (not knowledgeable enough to know what they are called lmao) next to the sticks themselves and while that helps for maybe a few days, it always comes back. What do you guys do to prevent this if you also suffer from it?"
PS4,ugy7dr,I thought my PS4 account was gone forever!,"I woke up this morning to discover that my account was hacked, someone spent hundreds of dollars and then changed the email. It was sooo stressful, but luckily it was resolved (not a lot of thanks to the horrible roundabout recovery method of PS).

So you have to make a new account just to fill out the information that the help bot needs. 

Once you're connected to a person, you'll give them the email and online id that was associated with the account. They also wanted the last four of the credit card I used on the account.

THIS IS KEY: I needed the pin number from the console that I originally created the account on. This means if you do not have the original console or said pin number, you're pretty much screwed. 

Whoever stole my account has nothing muhaha! They purchased Call of Duty and Elden Ring (among others), so I hope those bastards feel the hurt of lost progress!"

It's a 3D action adventure game with lots of puzzles with blocks, balls, fans, switches on the floor, etc. It's kind of like Talos Principle x Assassin's Creed or something. To do these puzzles you often have to teleport into a separate level. Sometimes you make your way around the platformed level/map, only to realize there's a ball/block way back at the start of the level that you needed to transport with you the whole way.

It's a sweet game, I highly recommend it."

\- No sports games; no multiplayer games (I don't have PS plus); no 2D games or Indie-like pixel style

Thanks!!"

This will be simple, like ""wears a mask"", to more knowledgable themes like ""is part of another superhero group than the JLA."" nothing is too simple or too nerdy.

If you can just throw a few themes at me that you can think of I'm going to make a big list and we will draw them out as we play to celebrate his wedding!

PS4,ud3cla,Fair and standard ps4 games,"Hi,

So I remember the days of 2000-2006, I was playing many PC games, including the most complicated than I have known at that time.

Even (most...) complicated games were very different from the current ones at the PS store, and it usually comes down to 2 basic differences:

1. It was user-friendly. Even RPG games that I have played were not overwhelming to the point where you just give up. You had a skill tree and items and the game knew that if the environment, the story, and the interactions were creative enough - it is going to be a good game.  
Now I find myself with almost no games to play.  
The only games I was able to at least finish were: Wolfenstein, Doom, Days gone  
Those games are not my cup of tea, and ""Days gone"" didn't even try to be an outstanding game - but at least I knew what to do.  
Now I play The Division 2 and I am so lost. I love the game, and I really don't mind if the games have further options and mechanics that I won't use and enjoy - as long as they are not interrupting my game experience.  
RPG games - you find yourself clueless and overwhelmed and the thing is, now many games that are not labeled as ""RPG"" also become so complicated.  
From the gear system of the new division to the burden of having to clean your gun every minute in RD2.
2. The games of this new era give you extra stuff (basically cheat codes) for money.  
I have no problem with that until I understand that if I want to play a fair and normal game online - I will just have to be satisfied with MK11.

Am I wrong here? Did I miss something?

I just want to enjoy standard games, preferably the kind that does have some creative options and features - are they still out there?

I want to play normal multiplayer shooting games, lest say 2 vs 2 like we used to play in the golden days of ""Quake"", without landing in a messy field of 100 players, knowing that some of them bought their gear with actual money.

Is there still room for people like me in the community? :O"

PS4,ucwr48,Which PlayStation Plus Subscription will u be getting?,"When the subscription launches in June, it will be available as three separate tiers: PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Plus Extra, and PlayStation Plus Premium. The Premium subscription will feature up to 700-plus games.

The standard PS Plus subscription will be rebranded to **PlayStation Plus Essential**. Despite the new name, it's functionally the same services. PS Plus Essential will cost $60 per year and feature the same perks, including free games each month, cloud storage, online multiplayer, and discounts during select sales.

**PlayStation Plus Extra** will cost $15 per month or $100 per year and features up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games. Sony's description of the Extra tier is a bit vague, but subscribers will be able to download the games in the library to their console to play.

It'll include both first-party and third-party games. Considering the number of games in this tier, it sounds pretty much like a combination of PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, which will be discontinued in June. Current PlayStation Now subscribers will be converted to PS Plus Extra subscribers at launch.

The most expensive of the bunch, **PlayStation Plus Premium**, will feature ""up to 340 additional games"" versus the Extra tier. PlayStation Plus Premium will cost $18 per month or $120 per year. The Premium tier's additional games appear to largely focus on the PlayStation back catalog, with original PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PSP games available to play. PS3 games will be locked to cloud streaming, but at least some of the other backwards compatible classics will be downloadable.

The Premium tier comes with a couple other perks, including limited-time game trials and cloud streaming on PC. All three subscription tiers will be available on PS5 and PS4, though PS5 users will get access to more games.

I think i need some time to think on this."

PS4,ucpshj,Venting about PS Store Purchase,"I have to vent to someone about this because... you may understand. I'll try to keep it brief:
*Purchased the $14.99 Monster Trucks add-on for Hot Wheels Unleashed. Yes, I think this is a rip off, however, my son LOVES monster trucks and we play video games to bond. I used the PS app to purchase it because I was at work and my wife was working from home with my son. 
*I checked out like I have dozens of times in the past. Got a confirmation email for my order. Got a notification my CC was charged. 
*Tried to initiate a download of content to PS4 at home but I didn't see the option. Facetimed with wife to walk her through how to check and download purchased add-ons on the ps4. The add on showed the price still and not purchased. 
*Walked my wife through the process to restore content licenses. It didn't work. 
*Called PS support. After 20 minutes I had to go b/c they couldn't figure out what was going on and I was at work... so I had to work. 
*Fast forward to 6pm. I called PS support again. After 31 minutes, I was told they see the game as purchased on their end, but they don't know why I cannot download it. They told me my only recourse was to contact the publisher directly to work it out. 
*When I asked for the game publishers information (Milestone), I was told to google it. I googled it. The only contact phone number listed is IN ITALY. 
*Reached out to PS store through chat bot. After about 8 minutes, I was told ""they'd make a one time exception"" and refund me, even though the content had been downloaded/used. It had not, hence my multiple attempts to resolve the issue.

Anyway, I probably wasted a very stressful hour dealing with this today, all for PS to treat it like it was my fault. I've been a PS user and account holder for as long as I can remember. I've never had an issue like this."

PS4,ub8uxk,Remote Play app,"Anyone know if this is getting support still? I just feel like there ways to improve this app, it's super useful but I always find myself having to reset the app every like 20-30 minutes because it just suddenly out of nowhere starts lagging like crazy and shows the connection error logo at the top. For me, it's a super useful app with having a baby and stuff and not always able to turn on the tv and play games like I used to. It would be neat if it was a little better though, I find connecting outside of the home is basically impossible though, which is weird that it's even an option. Unless you had 1gig internet at the house and at the location you are remoting from, then I'm sure it's decent. Just curious if there is any updates or future apps in the works to replace it. Just feels like it needs more support."

I play alot of Splitgate, and every season they have a referral pass and rewards for new players. Friends in Xbox say they've got a native LFG function, so its pretty easy for them to find and link up with new players. Most of the time I'm hitting up friends on Apex to come try it, and half like it amd half either hate it and never try it, because everyone loves their own comfort zone haha.

So, just curious what good LFG ps4 resources anyone knows about.

PS4,ua6s05,Games like COD MW2 for Casual Gamers,"I'm a very casual gamer - I have two young kids so I play a few hours here and there a month. I don't play online, just single player story mode.

However, most modern games are very deep and complicated with all the crafting, upgrading weapons and character, editing loadout, earning new abilities, etc.

COD MW2 is ideal - you just turn it on and play and the controls are simple and intuitive enough to get quickly reacquainted when you haven't played in a while.

I've tried some of the more recent COD games like Black Ops but they're way too complicated and deep for me.

PS4,u9r0rj,"God of War Digital Deluxe Edition, $17.99","Ok first, I don't use reddit and I'm not sure how any of it works or if this will get a response? But I just wanted to ask if it's worth getting the game in title (God of War Digital Deluxe Edition). It's on sale (Spring Sale until 4/28) in the Play Station Store for about 18 bucks. I've done a little research and people say the digital deluxe for GoW (2018) is not worth. But rn, it's cheaper than the standard edition ($19.99).

Should I just buy the digital deluxe now, or wait until the standard edition goes on sale for potentially cheaper than $18? Thanks in advance for any replies."
PS4,u9pjsv,"Um cl√°ssico, Need for Speed MW", 
PS4,u9pbae,Where is this supposedly impossible game that people keep complaining about? Forbidden West first impressions and theory why so many people find it so damn hard,"For reference: beat Horizon Zero Dawn twice on the difficulty below Ultra Hard. Beat DLC on the same difficulty once. Got the Plat trophy, but not all DLC trophies (yet).

Where I am at the game: \[Spoiler\] I just did the futuristic human boss battle. I find it out to be a fun sequence all around and despite the new characters suffering from ridiculous SCI-fi clothing syndrome, I believe the story can be quite great if they develop them right. DO NOT SPOIL ME OR I WILL KILL YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY \[Spoiler\].

&amp;#x200B;

Before getting the game I read some forums (doing my best to avoid spoilers, and since I am pretty much a black belt in that art I managed to do so) and one of the main complaints/critiques is that the game is too hard. **I am playing on Very Hard** doing side quests and upgrading my equipment (without going out of my way to upgrade them to tier 3) and so far I can't find the major differences. Once you upgrade the Spear it can do a lot of damage to small/mid machines, the containers seem to be easily triggered, parts fall off after one or two hits... seem to be about the same difficulty.

&amp;#x200B;

""The issue is playing the game just as you played Zero Dawn, you won't succeed that way in this game"". I mean, so far I've been playing like exactly the same. Start off with a sneak attack, kill small machines with Silent Strikes, hit canisters for elemental explosions, shoot off weak spots for damage. The only thing I find myself doing differently is using the Spike for general damage against some more troublesome units and using more traps. The latter feels great though? Can't see how it could be considered a downside. So far I haven't missed the long roll, and yeah, I didn't exactly engaged against big machines because I need to be stronger, although I did went madlad mode and engaged a Thunderjaw by a Bandit Camp with a Deathbringer gun (from a carcass, so no spoilers here, they might not be in the game, I don't know) and after doing some pitiful damage and angering the big fella I managed to dodge his ramming attack and ran away like a bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

Machines so far seem to be slightly more aggressive, but nothing like I expected to by reading some complaints. After some attacks they slow down or outright stop for a bit. Alloy gets up slower but I never got stunlocked and I think by now I played like 13 hours and never ran from a comba, and had my share of combats against multiple enemies. Maybe it's something they fixed? Only difference I noticed is that even some small/mid enemies attacks hit like trucks, but they are always the easiest to dodge (and that might be a Very Hard thing, not sure). Oh, and I'm not even using Surges right now.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory to the complaints regarding difficulty is that a lot of players beat the first game and DLC on normal and maybe even got the Plat that way, and thought to themselves ""yeah, time to get my gamer badge and beat this on Hard, I got this, I beat the whole game before"" and did so only to find out that the game on hard (or very hard) is, well, hard. If they played the first on Hard they would probably have trouble finishing it. I think playing on normal might instill some bad habits IF you are trying to play on high difficulties, like only relying on spear and bow damage and spamming rolls. **On higher difficulties, even on the original game,** you needed to use elements, canisters, traps, the Ropecaster and enemy weapons (like Disc Launcher) effectively to win.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, if you are not having fun just turn down the difficulty, no one cares, just have fun. I played games on Normal all my life until I hit like 22 (and that's playing games since like 7), and I still want to revisit Bioshock on normal because on hard the early game was a death simulator lol. In regards to other complaints, I think 95% of them are completely... weird? But that is a post for another day. So far I am having an absolute motherfucking blast with this game, and I honestly don't see that changing at all."

PS4,u7bdhe,"if you are wondering what tv you should buy for playstation, wonder no more.","Don't buy tv, buy a projector.

I did it, and its awesome.

Pros
- on my current setting i have a ~100 inch screen
- its 60 fps with 13ms lag (or something around that)
- you CAN play during the day, just close curtains
- even though mine is full HD its still good - its diffrent on projectors, full HD on 100 inch screen looks bad, here even on 300 inch screen (max) its still good. 
- during night its amazing experience. Both gaming and watching movies. I played pacific rim as i wanted to test it, and its like watching the movie first time again. 

Cons
- you need a white wall big enough for it
- during day you need to close curtains on your windows
- even then colors could be better (not great but also not too bad not to play)
- you need external speakers
- if you wanna true 4k then its very expensive 

Myths
- its quiet, can't hear it during gaming (ps4 is a looooot louder)
- if its not china you can comfortably play during day


Just my take on it"

PS4,u7b9gp,I think it‚Äôs time to say goodbye :(,"I just can‚Äôt enjoy playing my PS4 anymore. It‚Äôs too loud for me. I‚Äôve taken it apart and cleaned it so many times, hoping that maybe that might make it quieter. Unfortunately, I feel like that‚Äôs only made it louder and slower. After 4 years though I‚Äôm also feeling let down and deeply saddened that my Pro couldn‚Äôt last. At least I got to somewhat enjoy the games I played; but now I think I‚Äôm gonna have to just scrap it because I‚Äôm out of options.

It feels like a waste of time and money at this point, and I‚Äôm getting mad about it. Like my gf‚Äôs slim is quieter than my pro and is older than it. What did I do wrong to my machine to make it become so useless and obsolete? I don‚Äôt think GameStop can take it because of how loud it is. It‚Äôs in really good condition, but I just think the fan is too loud and they won‚Äôt be able to take it.

Anyways. Thanks for reading if you did, have a good day and be thankful of your Consoles working when they do."

PS4,u66r96,I'm actually glad that trophies aren't meant to be accessible.,"I mean come on. We have tons of accesibility features for games like letting people enjoy stories without gameplay holding them back and many more. I'm all for making the gaming experience as accessible and available for all kinds of people but messing with trophies aren't the way to go.

Trophies are meant for the so called ""elite"" people who want to explore and experience every piece of a game. Skill based trophies to exploration trophies, they are there to reward players who go out of their way to truly enjoy these games. Revealing hidden trophies or making all of them easily obtainable for the casual player just ruins the whole system in my opinion.

If you're someone who collects trophies or anything like that, you can always look up hidden trophies from the internet since you're not trying to figure it out trophies yourself in the first place anyways. Plus, certain trophies being hard to obtain is specifically why they're rewarding. I'm somewhere between a sweaty gamer to average player so I'm happy when I get a rare trophy or anything knowing my passion for the game was rewarded.

I just don't see why trophies should be accessible."

PS4,u5ggcu,PlayStation account primary glitch,"
So I've came across two glitches involving account primary stuff.

1.My friend owned a game and I activated his
account as primary it later had shown that in my account I had purchased it even after deleting hisaccount off my PS4 I now own that game.

2. Similar to the last situation this one was even more weird it happened to my friend J and his friend B . So B owned the forest and he put his account as primary on J playstation and activated it as primary but then it put the forest into J purchased library of games I know it's
not just a visual glitch because ians Account is activated as primary on my playstation and I was able to download the and play the forest.

(Sidenote I'm not complaining at all I just thought this was a cool bug that we came across my friends was able to share his game to my account and I end
up being able to own the game) anyone have any thoughts on this or similar situations?"

I want to buy a certain game for my girlfriend as a gift, but it is significantly cheaper to go through the PSN store right now than anywhere else so I'd like to do it that way.

PS4,u3yd23,"DC Games Will Reportedly be ""Bolstered"" Under Warner Bros. Discovery"," 

According to a new report, [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://comicbook.com/category/warner-bros-discovery/) is aware that [DC Entertainment](https://comicbook.com/category/dc-entertainment/) is not utilized enough in the gaming space. Over the last decade, the only AAA DC games that have been released are the [Batman](https://comicbook.com/category/batman/): Arkham games, two Injustice games, some LEGO titles, and the Telltale Batman series. Largely, these all revolve around Batman for the most part and it highlights a growing issue with DC's representation in one of the biggest mediums in entertainment. This year, [DC will release *Gotham Knights*](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/gotham-knights-release-date/), a game featuring the Batfamily, and [next year, it will release *Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League*](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-delay/). It was also recently revealed that a Wonder Woman game is in the works, but it's still likely years away from release.

In a [new report from Variety](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/dc-warner-bros-discovery-zaslav-hbo-max-1235232185/) which claims [Warner Bros. Discovery is looking to overhaul DC Entertainment](https://comicbook.com/dc/news/dc-entertainment-overhaul-warner-bros-discovery/), it was revealed that the company believes it needs to do more to grow the comic book brand. Although DC has a routine presence on the big screen, the report notes that the company is looking into bolstering DC's gaming efforts. As of right now, there's no indicator as to what that could look like, but it shows that the company is aware it can certainly do better. Many have been asking for games based on [Superman](https://comicbook.com/category/superman-comic/), The Flash, the Justice League, and many other key heroes, but nothing has come of it. [Warner Bros. Discovery reportedly believes that Superman needs to be revitalized](https://comicbook.com/dc/news/superman-warner-bros-discovery-reportedly-believes-needs-to-be-revitalized/) after a mixed reception to the character's recent on-screen appearances and then being abandoned.

Perhaps this will lead to Superman being represented in games soon as an effort to revive the character as a larger pop culture icon. Batman has dominated gaming for quite some time, but it's time for DC to expand these efforts with its plethora of rich characters. Of course, this will take a lot of time, but hopefully, it will pay off."
PS4,u3xrz2,PS4 Touchpad not working in The Last of Us,"So for some reason I cannot use the touchpad of my Dualshock 4 (PS4 controller) when playing The Last of Us.
It works perfectly fine in every other game that utilized it, but not that one specific game. Without crafting there's no way for me to do anything. (I'm not good enough to beat the game without making Medic Kits and Shivs)
It worked at first, but one day out of the blue it just stopped working. (Again, ONLY for that one game, so it's not a hardware problem)
My guess it's a The Last of Us update problem (so maybe others have the same issue), but not sure since nothing of it is online.

I found a reddit with a similar issue, but without an answer. Besides that ONE Reddit, I cannot find anything on the matter.

At parties when I hang out with friends, the popping noise happens every second, and not able to enjoy spending time with friends without being annoyed. 

I did many things to try to solve this problem.

New headset

New controller

Unplugged HDMI cord

Cleaned fan

Restarting PlayStation

Restarting controller

Putting USB cable into the controller to connect to PlayStation

Restarting wifi

PS4,u1989c,How can Sony get away with such a horrible return policy in 2022?,"I'm a casual gamer these days, felt like playing something new. After a bit of searching, I landed on Ghost of Tsushima. Looks like a fun single player experience, just what I'm looking for. So I open up the PS Store, search for it and see [two versions: Legends and Director's Cut](https://i.imgur.com/lwZ7OL7.png). Seeing how these are the only two versions available, I assume that Legends is the base version, while Director's Cut is all the extra bells and whistles I wouldn't want anyway. (One thing I truly despise about modern gaming is all the different versions, add-ons, season passes, DLCs, but I digress.)

Thus, I proceed and purchase Legends, only to find out after playing it for about 15 minutes that I've been duped, and it's a multiplayer co-op add-on I would never play in a million years. The single player campaign that I wanted? Oh, you gotta buy the Director's Cut edition for that. You know, the one that sounds like it's chock full of extra useless fluff, but it's really the only way to play the base game? Yeah, that. 

So no problem, right, I'll just contact support for a refund. I even said that I'd accept a gift card, they don't need to send my money back. Well, they just told me to go pound sand because I ""started downloading it."" 

I realize I could have been more thorough in my research before purchase, but, given the circumstances I just described, I think it's a fairly easy mistake to make by any consumer that's not a hardcore gamer. The vague description on the PS Store surely didn't help, there was nothing under Legends that would indicate that it lacked the single player campaign.

I'm puzzled how Sony can get away with such an anti-consumer, inflexible return policy in 2022."

David Haddad remains WB Games head amid WB-Discovery leadership shuffleIts remain unknown which of the game studios will remain under Warner Bros. Games or AT&amp;T

WB Games head David Haddad will keep his role despite a significant shakeup in the leadership ranks as parent company WarnerMedia merges with Discovery.

[As per the Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-executives-named-1235112576/), Discovery CEO David Zaslav yesterday announced new leadership appointments for the newly joined companies, with Haddad keeping his post.

He will report to JB Perrett, the newly appointed lead of the company's streaming and gaming business operations.

Haddad originally joined the company in 2013 and [was appointed](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-01-08-david-haddad-appointed-head-of-warner-bros-gaming) as head of the Warner Bros. gaming division back in 2015.

PS4,u0e5ge,PSN needs to fix their report system.,"Seriously, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I‚Äôm in a group chat with a lot of friends I made on games and two of them got their accounts permanently banned. There was no toxicity, we‚Äôre just cussing and talking to each other like friends, joking around. Not sure if someone in the chat reported us or if they were somehow automatically picked up by a bot, but it‚Äôs ridiculous. I have a theory it was someone in the chat since there was a previously toxic dude in the chat who was being an asshole and we removed him, and I believe someone else in the group chat was friends with him, so he may have purposely reported our messages as revenge. It would make sense because that toxic guy is known for getting people suspended by reporting them constantly. It‚Äôs ridiculous how we can get banned just for cussing jokingly with friends, I‚Äôm sick of how much this report system is being abused. I can‚Äôt even jokingly curse with friends in group chats or in parties for fear that I may get suspended."

PS4,u0b7i2,Days Gone 2 - Disappointing,"So I am playing Days Gone again for the 20th or 30th time...quite frankly I've lost count.

This is one of the best games I've ever played. The narrative is probably the best I've experienced in a long time, more so for a Post Apocalyptic  game.

I'd like to ask now..... was anyone else sorely disappointed when Sony rejected Days Gone 2? The game was left on a cliff hanger.....and now.... nothing."
PS4,u095o3,The amount of ads in the youtube app...,"Did the youtube app updated suddenly? Because now I'm getting an inhuman quantity of ads in every single video just in my ps4.

Compared to My Pc and Android device, these are less common, in my phone I can get like 2 or 3 in a 15 min video, but in the ps4 app this goes very far."

Every time i try to play an online game it pulls up a big ad for ps plus and says that. Don‚Äôt have it even though I still have 4 months of it left. I‚Äôve tried all the basic fixes like restarting my console and unplugging it and plugging it back in yet nothing has fixed it.

PS4,u02bpt,MGS V TPP why I like the helicopter loading screen.,I've heard a lot of people complain about the long unskippable helicopter loading scene before each mission. I really like this part of the game because it's extremely realistic. I was a white water raft guide and active duty army (did not see combat or fly in any helicopters) but the reason why I like this loading screen is because it gives you the very realistic feeling of the emotional roller coaster of doing scary things that have a long and boring drive to get to. It's really common to have a very calm and mellow ride in a vehicle when you just stare out at the world on your way to go do something really intense and scary or to have that scenic ride back after a crazy event when you get to meditate and reflect on either what you're about to go do or what you just did. The really mellow and relaxing ride gives a great contrast to the intense moments in the game that helps make them seem more substantial because of the contrast. In a world of games with instant respawn a non-stop action the realisticness of the emotional roller coaster of actually doing intense things is is often lost. It's all the little things like this in all the metal gear solid games that really help make them an experience and more than just another game.

So I live in an off-grid house and do not have a landline internet connection. I just picked up a copy of COD:MW (2019) from a pawn shop yesterday and discovered after downloading all 36 gigs of the game The single player will not play without an update. My PlayStation hasn't been online in over 2 years. I'm pretty sure this means that the game was printed and boxed at the factory entirely non-functional knowing they would force you to download the entire game as an update when you put the disc in for the first time. What was the point of even having the 36 gigs of information on the disc if it's just a glorified unlock key for the download version? How was it even legal to sell a completely unfunctional product like this?"

I like open world rpgs/action games like Witcher 3, God of war, Horizon ZD. I know ps4 has a lot more, like The last of us 1/2. What I'm lookin for is a list of ""must have"" games like that to play once I get a PS5. I know there's Bloodborne, Uncharted 4/5 and Spider Man as well, but surely i'm missing some titles. Can you suggest me some so then i can also plan and see whats the best way for me to play them? I guess most are old so they probably sell cheap (and a Ps5 isnt really easy to find right now at a decent price) but before i decide I need to have a list of what I'll want to play.  


Thanks a lot!

PS4,tzblzq,Watch Dogs 2 Was Awesome,"I got the Platinum for this game a few years ago and I just decided to start playing it again. I‚Äôll say it once and I‚Äôll say it again: Watch Dogs 2 is one of my all time favorite games and certainly one of the best of 2016. The open world is extremely underrated and full of fun.

Where do you guys put 2 in the overall rankings of open world games? I just feel like it was so fun, care free and I love the vibrancy of SF. Sure it may look a little too bright but I just love that about it.

The NPC‚Äôs are pretty funny and entertaining as well. I‚Äôve come across so many weird conversations and people getting into fights, etc. I already beat the game but I still have some Driving and Scout missions left. Even though it‚Äôs over I find myself coming back to just drive around and enjoy the city. It made me actually book a trip to SF in the near future. 

Ok, now I‚Äôll stop gloating and raving about the game and go back to playing it!"

PS4,tz6asx,fasely suspended for a month.,"i got suspended for 4 weeks due to ""violations of the community guidelines"", which is really annoying, and after reading the whole guidelines, i couldnt find any reason for me to get banned, execpt me and my friends jokingly insulting eachother, and i didnt even feel like i went too far, but none of us reported eachother, and none of my friends got suspended, not even my friend that already got suspended like 10 times, exept me?

this is extremely bad for me as i feel like absolute shit without playing with my friends, and i have no other way to play with them.

is there any way i can contact playstation support (rather not call, but thats also an option i guess) to ask them to unsuspend me, or atleast tell me the reason???"

PS4,txpem2,should I get games that are in game pass,"Not sure if I'll get banned or likewise for talking about x b o x on ps4 reddit so I'll be discreet. Long story short I got a x b o x about a year ago. As you may or may not know game pass allows you to play hundreds* of games on a monthly subscription. When I received the x b o x the plan was to only play ps exclusives, and I'll play all the other games on game pass, plans have gone awry. There's a sale on the ps store; I was thinking of getting control, little nightmares 1&amp;2 and the batman Arkham* trilogy. But then I would just be wasting money no, as some (if not all) of those games are on game pass."

The game was fine at first , managed to play it for a couple of days , maybe like 4-5 days and then the progress issue popped up -talked to Playstation support and they gave me my refund


With that money I was given back I bought another game and I havent played it for more than 30 minutes and noticed the absolutely horrible frame drops which made the game unplayable/unenjoyable and it really broke my heart since o really wanted to play it

But when I requested the refund they told me that since I opened the game and played it I camt get the refund... of a game I haven't played for more than 30 minutes...

Yet I got a refund for a game I tried for several days... 

I'm not upset about it , I guess I'll just have to live with it but I'm just disappointed with the consistency of PS Support

Tiers --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Firstly, they would have to remove the 'Extra Tier'. This would give the 'Essential Tier' more benefits.
Benefits --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Essential - access to PS4 and PS3 games (all games are downloadable)
‚Ä¢ Premium - access to PS2, PS1 and PSP games (all games are downloadable)
Additional Perks --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Monthly downloadable games
‚Ä¢ Cloud gaming (for mobile and PC)
‚Ä¢ Free games 
‚Ä¢ EA Play
‚Ä¢ Online multiplayer
Cloud Saves --&gt; Does not require a subscription
More Perks --&gt; ‚Ä¢ Play games on PS Plus the same day they release
‚Ä¢ Early access to games on Premium Tier
‚Ä¢ Free in-game content
Prices --&gt; Price Per Month:
‚Ä¢ $9.99 (Essential)
‚Ä¢ $14.99 (Premium) 

Price Per Year: 
$59.99 (Essential)
$99.99 (Premium) 

Family Plan: 
$79.99 Annually (Essential)
$119.99 Annually (Premium) 

If PlayStation managed to make all these changes to their service by June, it could become better than the xBox Gamepass, or at least the same."

Maybe I think the damage I deal is fine but I'm getting one shotted. I can adjust as I see fit. 

I like that it's not a one size fits all super easy or super hard but there's a lot of nuance in between. The easy loot especially is pretty superb for grinding.

All games for PlayStation‚Äôs new tiered subscription service; PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra and Premium. This list is sorted by quickest platinum and base game completion times.

Welcome to NODE Gamers‚Äô massive list of over 1500+ games; these games are all part of PlayStation+ (Essential, Extra and Premium), PlayStation‚Äôs new tiered subscription service.

This list is tailored towards trophy hunters, looking for the quickest platinum‚Äôs, or just quick games for trophies that you can work your way through. We will also include a hyperlink to the end for those of you who want longer games, or games most likely to contain Ultra Rare trophies.

The games included in PlayStation+ are already quite familiar. Tier 1 includes the PS Plus we already know, tier 2 includes PSNow‚Äôs PS4 range and will now include PS5 games, Tier 3 will include PSNow‚Äôs PS3 range. There are other benefits but we are solely focusing on games with trophy support."
PS4,tsbh61,Spartacus isn't a good idea.,"Its a good idea if you just want to have the basic ps plus version and don't care about the ps now aspect. Its good if you want the ps plus and ps now both at the same time. But it's not good if you want ps now without psplus Sometimes I just want ps plus without ps now. Sometimes I just want ps now without ps plus. 
What if I start out thinking oh I just want ps plus, so I buy a year of the base plan, and then 2 months in I decide, hey I actually want to play ps now for a month. In the old separate way I could just spend ten dollars and have ps now for a month. Now what's going to happen? I already bought a year of the base plan (just ps plus) now I want to add ps now, so I have to pay for more ps plus just to play ps now ? How would it even work, would it override the current ps plus only month and then wedge in the ps plus and ps now , and then when that month is over revert back to the old ps plus only subscription?
They should remain separate it gives the consumer more flexibility."

I turn it on and it boots up fine but will not connect to my wifi booster. I have fought this for over a week with no results. I‚Äôve tried every thing I can find on the internet and YouTube. All my devices will connect to my extender but my PS4 will not. It will connect to my router that is one room away but not to the extender that is in the same room as my PS4. I am thinkin of running of running an Ethernet cord from my extender to the PS4 next to see if that works. Has anyone ever had this problem before? The software is up to date.
PS4,tqsu0t,I think my ps4 is fucked,"I've had my ps4 for about 6 years now and it hasn't run into any major problems until now. About a year ago I was playing when suddenly the ps4 ejected the disc by itself. I shrug it off as just a weird thing that happened except it kept ejecting discs for no reason. So I watched a video which told me to take the rubber foot off the bottom, which I did. This solved the problem immediately and I thought that was that. However my ps4 also started experiencing another problem which was shutting down randomly. It would beep randomly, and then the ps4 just shut off completely as if someone pulled the plug. I know it isn't overheating because just yesterday I was literally on the home menu not even doing anything when it just shut off randomly. And to make it worse my ps4 is now randomly ejecting discs again. Again, I know it's not overheating because it just does it when I'm not even doing anything, and I clean my ps4 quite regularly sooooo yea. 





My ps4 is fucked."

PS4,tqo2ou,At 30 years old I have FINALLY embraced my love for video games.,"I think after years of going the digital route, the physical discs and cases have created this sorta nostalgic feeling to gaming for me. It rekindles this love that I‚Äôve always had as a kid but somewhere along my path of growing up it was suppressed by family and friends. I still played video games but felt weird about expressing how I felt about the story of certain games, their characters and the world created in them. Now for some reason at the age of 30 I have finally gotten over that (maybe subconscious I‚Äôm not sure) thought/feeling of, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt love video games that way and stop being lazy‚Äù feeling and have fully embraced my love for them.

I‚Äôve expressed this before to a few people and their reply was, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably because of its now popularity of the gaming community.‚Äù Which of course that could definitely be it but maybe because of the now popularity, I now have this feeling like I‚Äôm part of a community and I‚Äôm not alone in my love for video games on a much bigger scale. I certainly didn‚Äôt have that feeling growing up but it‚Äôs nice to have it now as I play with random strangers and we strike up a friendship and express together the love we have over the same things. 

This was just a random thought that I had as I was typing this in a reply to another post/comment. So I felt like sharing this epiphany that just occurred with me. 

Thank you to everyone out there that has been kind enough to play some video games and have a chat with me."

I might be over-scrupulous here, but..

1. It‚Äôs plastic-ky and feels poorly built. I hate that there is not much of a heft to it. Doesn‚Äôt feel solid in the hands. Sony could have used some higher quality plastic along with rubber grips under-neath and for the sticks.

2. Buttons are mushy. I love how the Macbook trackpad clicks. The buttons could also be pressure sensitive (something like 3D Touch?)

3. R3 and L3 sticks can be made pressure sensitive or adaptive. Like when you are pulling a lever in Uncharted or GOW, the sticks can offer more resistance as you are completing the pull.

4. The touch pad can be put on the back of the controller so that it can accessed by the ring finger?

Coming to the title, I‚Äôm a huge Apple fanboy and I wonder what innovation could Apple bring to a game pad?

What are your thoughts?"

In the case we belive it in its entirety (both what each sub tier entails and what their prices are), I I'm fairly certain that the current PS+ subscription translates to the new Gold edition.

Please correct me if wrong, but if we compare prices, there is a difference of whole 15 fucking dollars per 3m(60$ for a year), which will be around the 50$ mark for the yearly subscription.

So currently the yearly sub is 59.99$ and the new (gold variant) will be imo 100$√∑120$. Does this mean that we will need to pay literally twice the amount for just keeping our benefits as they are now?? 

Its absolutely stunning for me, especially since the sub increased in price no more than 1-2y ago...."

PS4,tqaruw,The PS4 is my first PlayStation. How I came to own it and what my first impressions are.,"**TL;DR** \- RemotePlay helped finally fit the PS4 into my life. Despite some baffling decisions or oversight, the graphical prowess and continued support for the platform is encouraging. If Sony could just do better with it's RemotePlay support, I would be ecstatic.

**Question:** What do you consider to be knockout features?  

\----------------------------------------------------

Being that I'm mostly on the go, I never seem to be able to find the time to actually be in one place long enough to game and make what I feel is significant progress - especially since I'm a fan of JRPGs or games that have RPG elements to them. It's why I've always leaned towards portables such as the 3DS, Vita and the Switch. 

**So why the PS4 now?**

Well, I've been a big fan of the Persona series. I've played Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden multiple times. I've also been able to distract myself when Persona 5 came out and also had some wishful thinking of it appearing on Switch. However, with Persona 5 Royal having been released and Persona 5 Strikers - the sequel to Persona 5 already out. It appears to me that the writing has been on the wall long enough to tell me that the mainline game won't be making an appearance. Especially since the previous entries never did.  

**But what about portability?** 

It didn't occur to me until a few weeks ago what Remote Play was really about, and that is the ability to play on a VITA, smartphone, or tablet on the go - so long as there is a WiFi/data connection. When that became apparent, the other shoe dropped. It was like a watershed moment. It was shortly after that a PS4 had found a new home. 

**What are your thoughts?**

It's been a week since I've owned the PS4. Here's some first impressions.

First the good stuff:

* I can't believe I didn't know about RemotePlay sooner! Being able to access the library on the go is a game-changer
* What a rich library of games! I feel like I'm in a fortunate position where there are so many quality games that have had enough time pass so that they can be bought at a fraction of the original price. In my eyes, that is a bargain. 
* I'm excited to experience the PS4's graphical prowess on the go. Beyond having it work on my phone and tablet, I've gotten it to work on the Chromecast too!
* I'm really happy to see that there are still new titles coming to the platform this year
* Being able to use this as a media center is pretty nifty - though I have yet to dive into it.
* The PSN Store UI is pretty nice

Room for Improvement

* The Settings menu needs a revamp somehow. Perhaps maybe it can learn through my usage of what settings I frequently toggle. (ex: connecting/disconnecting my controller since I use it on the go)
* Why no Bluetooth audio support?
* RemotePlay is amazing - when it works. I live in a major city and take a bus to work. There are several moments where there are just dropped connections. Is this a compression issue or something?
* Can Sony please come up with a compact controller on the go or some kind of more pocket-friendly peripheral? You can't necessarily slide the controller into your pants pocket."

PS4,tpt0wv,"Watch ""The guy at the bottoms died"" on YouTube", 
PS4,tpt00v,Is there a site to know the game/dlcs size ?,I know you can view them from the store but it's annoying to have to go to it and search for every game and dlc + you can't even do that if you already bought the game so is there a website for that ?
PS4,tprxkk,How the PS4 Collection is going so far, 
PS4,tpr844,PS4 Faulty HDD,"unfortunately I‚Äôve been dealing with this issue for months now, I‚Äôve had my PS4 Pro for maybe a year and a half but have never had any issues until about 6 months ago when my internal harddrive decided to stop working. I‚Äôve lost all my clips, screenshots, and ability to play any game. 

I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs on an extremely small budget so I can‚Äôt just go out and buy a new console as much as I‚Äôd love to.

anyone have or know of someone who would have a 1TB PS4 Pro harddrive for sale please let me know."
PS4,tpqvyc,I can't use ultra low latency on YouTube for PS4 live.,"Hello,

So basically everytime I change the option to ultra low latency, after going live and I check the settings again, it's back on normal latency, which is really bad and I am unable to change the settings while the game is being broadcast.

Anyway to fix the issue? Is the PS4 not allowed to play in ultra low latency on YouTube Livestream?

In the meantime i used both of my ps4 controllers on the steamlink. So now i wanted to play some spiderman again and my controllers wouldn't connect to the system at all. First i tried charging them up via a seperate cable and the orange light was showing. Did not resolve the issue. The i tried to reset the controllers multiple times and that did not work either.
I started the steamlink and made sure they werent connected and tried again.
I tried both front usb ports on the system and the back ones.

PS4,tpijna,Dreams - 3rd Annual Impy Awards (starts at 7:00pm), 
PS4,tpgqn9,Game suggestions to improve skills,"Hey everyone - looking for suggestions of games that might help me get better at playing. At the moment I just end up madly smashing buttons and flailing around whenever there is any action...

Experience so far:
Completed Horizon ZD by myself and am working on the Frozen Wilds expansion at the moment.
 Death Stranding was a disaster, so stressful with the baby squeaking all the time and constantly dropping all of the luggage so I gave up on that....
I also play little bits of various Assassin's Creed and Far Cry to ""help"" my hubby but its nothing involving actual skill lol"
PS4,tpdpl8,"Why boosting and trophy-hunting is not so betrayable, than usual coop?","Ok, my iPhone doesn‚Äôt know the word ¬´betrayable¬ª‚Ä¶ well I‚Äôm not perfect in English‚Ä¶ 
I am a trophy hunter, I‚Äôve been boosted (I was a host of boost every time, so I need to rule order, time and communication etc.) a lot for it, rdr1 for poker face and kingpin, gta4 pietrovich and highest rank and the others.
So why no one leaves after getting your own trophy? We are about 4-10 ppl for example, and no one really leaves. Had a boost for 1x1 - the same situation. I played 20-30 hours for this guy, he‚Äôs done, but not left me‚Ä¶."

It started about 2 days ago when I was just playing and I went AFK for a second and came back to my player randomly moving forward.

PS4,toyf0t,Cursed ps4 controller? (help?),"Okay so here's a little context. I recently started getting some pretty serious stick drift on my one working controller so I went to the store to pick up a new one. I got home, opened it up, turned it on and plugged it in and it worked fine. The next day I tried turning on my controller and I got nothing, the light didnt go on, the reset button didnt work etc. it was dead dead. I didnt have the recipt bc I'm a dumbass and got rid of it asap so I counted it as a loss and went on with using the drifting controller for a few months, I had little ways of fixing it (turning it upside down and giving the sticks a wiggle, using a pin to clear out debris) and it was useable for the most part. Well yesterday I decided I was sick of the drift and decided to transfer over the battery from the drifty one to the new one in hopes that I could use it again. Long story short it worked, I turned it on, no drift no problems, basically a brand new controller. 5 mins later I took it home (fixed it at my parents bc they have the tools I need) and when I got home the controller didnt turn on. Again. I couldn't plug it in, I couldn't press the reset, nothing worked. Now I have no controllers that work and I'm very frustrated that my ps4 controller is frying all my batteries. I dont really know what to do other than go buy a new one and I was mostly just going on here to rant lmao but if any of yall have ideas please send them my way."

PS4,tol9ne,Should I replay Horizon ZD before playing Horizon FW?,"I hope to be getting a PS5 in a couple of months and Horizon FW will be the first game I intend to play on it. I am a fan of the original game. I played it once only a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. At the moment I don't really have a list of games I want to play so I was wondering why not get into HZD again before I get to play HFW. That way the story will be fresh in my mind.

However, a thing about open world games like HZD is that halfway through the game the gameplay becomes boring and exhausting. I don't want to finish HZD and then jump straight into HFW and experinece similar gameplay for another 60 or so hours.

So my question is, should I finish HZD again before leading up to HFW or skip HZD, read the synopsis of the original game, and go into HFW fresh?"

Hold down the right bottom corner of touchpad and press right analog stick.

PS4,toc7zi,Felt like I was scammed.,I‚Äôm not sure how to frame this or if it‚Äôs ever happened to anyone else. I got a notice on my PlayStation saying that I was permanently banned from the network for violating community rules. I couldn‚Äôt log on I was blocked. I found the error code and it regarded chargebacks and the reversal of charges for bundle purchases I‚Äôd made. I checked with my financial institution that I used and they said all the payments were processed for the purchases and weren‚Äôt charged back. I emailed PlayStation Network and explained this. They send a email basically reiterating that I charged back the purchases and gave me a balance I had to pay. I had to purchase PlayStation store credits from a store and enter the codes. I buy a card for more than the amount owed by $5.00. Later I received an email from them saying the card had insufficient funds to lift the ban and gives me another balance to pay that was $6.00 less than the original balance owed. Next time I buy a $50.00 card submit the code. After about 6 hours or so I received another email explaining the ban had been lifted. So after paying $75.00 on a $50.00 charge the ban was lifted but the strange part is I check my transactions made and only the bundle purchases and the $25.00 card store cash payment are shown in transactions and not the other $50.00 card I purchased. Nor was there any balance for overpayment. Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else on the PlayStation Network?

They lowered your in game credits per race  by an average of 33% in order to ‚Äúmore closely align the prices of in-game cars to their real-life counter parts. 

This essentially means they don‚Äôt want people to grind for cars but they want them to spend actual money on virtual goods held on a server that will be shut down eventually. 

I requested a refund and got rejected but I‚Äôm going to keep requesting. I hope people here too will too.

Things got progressively worse and now I cannot actually get into the ps4 without a constant death loop of ""Database is corrupted, PS4 will restart.""

Went ahead and rebuilt the database a few times to no avail. Got desperate and initialized the ps4 as well, still the same end result.

I removed and put the harddrive back in to see if that would magically fix it. We knew it wouldn't!

Bought a 2 TB external harddrive. Now I am not the most tech-savvy so bear with me here. Can I just use that external harddrive and totally remove the internal to see if it resolves? Or does the ps4 need an internal?

If so, what do I need to do?

1- I wanna follow the birth of the ""series"", would starting with Bloodborne/Sekiro not allow me to see the progress made over time?

2-Since Ive waited so long at this point, would waiting for potential PS5 remasters be worth it or should I just jump in now?

I took a big break in gaming entirely from 2012-2019, I enjoyed combat in GoW, which was chaged to ""Souls-like"". It was awesome and I want another similar experience."

Yeah, Bloodborne and Elden Ring aren't 'dark Souls', but the combat and mechanics are basically the exact same.  I personally love it all sure, but its also no different from how CoD gets copy and pasted over and over, if we're honest.

PS4,tkw7de,Horizon Forbidden west vs Elden ring what both did so good personal opinion,"By mainly comparing the 5 key features of both of them that I have taken: 

## i)LORE:

Horizon Forbidden west is longer most probably if considering only the cutscenes and total events that occur in the main storyline whereas Elden ring¬† story is shorter a little if you don‚Äôt do anything extra and get the 2 great runes only do the main questline so the rating according to the story of both : **Horizon 9.2 Elden ring 9.1 and remember the 2 stories are of different categories** one is fantasy future world and one is fully new fantasy world and one uses technology improvements and new AI‚Äôs whereas the other is based on becoming the Elden Lord and runes and great runes and both containing some interesting twists and in ELDEN RING you can change the ending whereas it‚Äôs not possible in HFW but you can change alloy‚Äôs personality and choices and be bold ,smart or kind are hear about everyone‚Äôs views and stories .

## ii)Graphics:

Both are huge open world games but Elden ring‚Äôs map is bigger but Horizon FW‚Äôs map is pretty big too and contains the ruins of San Francisco and many more old world ruins and both have great graphics but HFW‚Äôs graphics is better and on an unrelated note Horizon‚Äôs is a more realistic approach so there is difference but Elden ring has very good graphics also considering the huge FANTASY DARK world so **HFW : 10 and Elden ring 9.6.**

### iii)Open world :

As far as the open world goes both games are super good with interesting side quests and extra features and both got interesting creatures considering the animals and monsters, demons, machines variety and both the worlds got various and interesting environments from twisters in the sand to sea and it‚Äôs beaches ,jungles, mountains and from scarlet rot lake to dragon ruins of caelid , dungeons and many many more so **RATINGS are Elden ring : 10(since it got everything from libraries turning upside down to a city underground and hidden and many many more)¬† and Horizon : 9.8** and horizon also got **huge sea world** as **you can swim everywhere and FLY** too .

### iv)Gameplay and combos :

Both have good gameplay and Elden ring got hack and slash and horizon FW got new combos finally but the ashes of war and spells and incantations make Elden ring gameplay too good as you can do many things from summoning your CLONE to using dragon incantations and HFW also got way more weapons and traps and you can ride a freaking Dino machine which breathes fire and has claws and you can fly and race too and you can be wolverine too in ELDEN RING so the following **RATING is : HFW 10 ELDEN RING 10**.

#### v)Side quests and NPC:

HFW has got many side quests and some are kind of continuations of first game‚Äôs side quest and there is interesting choices in these side quests and the side characters have personalities and ego for example when there is to decide who will be the clan leader of DESERT CLAN and you can choose and try to convince both of them. Elden ring has got good NPC designs and structure and got a imp side quest that affects the storyline and unlocks many more things and major characters have good personalities and¬† interesting connections but non major NPC‚Äôs are like normal NPC they give you a task or tell you to find something and you can bring it to them and some helps you in boss fights so the Rating is HFW 10 , Elden ring 9.

It's basically Nioh. A bit different. Sadly not as deep as Nioh's combat system, but it's still a ton of fun.

if you view this in the same league as an arcade brawler, pure gameplay and ignore the story, least until the second half, you will have a really good time. Purely from a combat standpoint, Team Ninja beats Fromsoft ten times over, and in battles I'm having more fun than in Elden Ring.

PS4,tkcbkc,"The lack of coverage and censoring over Gran Turismo 7 having microtransactions, lootboxes and progression similar to a F2P gacha game but priced 70-80$ is extremely concerning.","Hopefully  for a lot of people on reddit this isn't news, Gran Turismo 7 released  and then patched the game to favor Microtransactions (credits) by quite  litteraly halving credits gains in all modes.

On  top of that, the game has a ""lootbox"" system (tickets) that you can get  daily from grinding some modes. The gain in the game is so bad that it  would take weeks just to unlock ONE of the high-end cars, which is  beyond madness for a console AAA game (of course, this is all bypasses  with real life money).

The  ticket/lootbox system is also very misleading and introduced in a way  that makes casual players think odds are in their favor. The existence  of that system in the game gives the likely possibility that the devs  can easily introduce those tickets as a paid optional currency.

With  the backlash of Battlefront 2 and how severe it was, i'm surprised that  the media and Sony themselves are trying their hardest to censor any  talk about this, even tho i find Gran Turismo 7 to be MILES MORE SCUMMY  than Battlefront 2 ever was (mainly because of how this was introduced).

I  follow some youtube channels that usually cover these kind of cases and  surprisingly they haven't covered it. A lot of mainstream gaming media  platforms also haven't talked about it in the slightest. I am very  afraid of the consequences and impact on the industry if the consumers  let this slide and do not voice their opinion.

Do  you seriously believe a barebones game with unfinished content, fully  priced, has the right to push you to use more money on the product to  unlock things that should be fairly obtainable through varied gameplay?  It is not the case here, not by a long shot. Gran Turismo 7 is one of  the highest selling games of the year so far and Sony has been trying to  cover up the bait &amp; switch. For more information, just go on [r/granturismo](https://www.reddit.com/r/granturismo/)  and filter top posts of the week. To sprinkle more salt over all this,  the game's producer quite litteraly told players the ""sense of pride and  accomplishment"" line."
PS4,tkc1z5,"Any indie devs on here? Curious to know how your game has sold, how Sony has been with willing to market, etc.","I see a lot of games pop up on the storefront that I just think to myself ""who in their right mind is going to buy this for $5 let alone 20"". Many games with weird settings nobody will ever really care about (such as sailors), trailers that show no gameplay (which is never a good sign), etc.

For those of you who did successfully launch, how was your experience? For those who succeeded or failed, would you do it again? I can't imagine much worse in life than spending years making a game only for it to sell like 100 copies. I'm not looking for failure stories to ""get off"" or anything stupid like that, just stuff like that seems interesting to hear about."

RDR2  (40-50fps) mostly on 1080p and on 900p better fps.
Bloodborne 
Uncharted 4

I mean even Battlefield games run upto 60fps on base ps4, with 1080p resolution. And looking at 
Dying Light 2, where it's 720p and not even 60fps. Worse!! It's not stable on 30fps either.

And if I am right, if developers just don't do it, than why aren't we talking about it. I mean HOGWARTS LEGACY is just around the corner and I want it to be 60fps on my console. We should atleast raise a voice about it."

I don't want to send it to get fixed because i still hope there might be a solution I could find which would fix my issue. 

I've tried everything, blowing inside with liquid oxigen, cd's are literally factory new, (i NEVER touch the bottom part) so no need to clean any, i restored the data, i even reinstalled the PlayStation software as indicated on the webpage, i tried the tapping technique, laying it on EVERY SINGLE side, i even tried to shake it a little while it was trying to read the cd, nothing. 
Nothing helped, does anybody know any other solution which might not involve disassembling the whole console? 

Facts that might be considered: for the last year or so, it's been standing vertically,
(i'm guessing that's why ""PLACING IT VERTICALLY"" doesn't solve my problem). I tried with all my physical games and it just won't read them."

Since when was there a shortage of ps4 controllers and why :/


Really sucks having to deal with stick drift every 2 months past- not having the means to fix it so having to buy new ones- only to find there aren‚Äôt any.. 

The store clerk said they‚Äôd not had any shipments of them since mid 2021.

Blows my mind that they‚Äôre in shortage seeing as there‚Äôs the new console and controller- what, did people give up the ps5 wait and get ps4s??

Hate to rant but I think some of Sonys products are just a waste of money. I‚Äôve paid around 400$ for the console, probably the same amount again for the many controllers that end up unusable after a couple months.. When I say unusable I mean it, it feels like playing with Tourette‚Äôs- your camera jerking and sliding everywhere with the slightest touch.

And no, it‚Äôs not a dead zone issue."

I don't want to bore you with any introductions or history of making this list so without further ado, I raise this post to help you know if game you want is worth buying. If you can't stand ""normal controls"", and standard camera control settings for you is inverted X and Y axis, games on this list got this feature. 

I hope that thanks to this list (that you will help me expand) will prevent you from buying game that it's not possible for you to play, cause of our x/y axis invert habbit.

Let's hope that game developers will be mindfull and prepare their games for people like us and such list won't be nessecery.

I'm not a gamer myself but I really want to help him find a more challenging game that he can enjoy. One of our together activities is basically me watching him play and it's like having my own personal streamer :)

You almost never have a game where you work a normal job as a doctor,lawyer, engineer or teacher.

I think the closest real life job that emulates being in a video game would be either a career criminal (bad) or a
Special Forces soldier (good)."

as a follow-up of the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/oe3l7u/lg_20172021_oleds_calibrated_settings_for_xbox/) I would like to share my **2022 Update** for my **FINAL** set of professionally **Calibrated Settings for all LG 2017-2022 OLEDs and Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 / PC gaming**, with the best PQ and lowest Input-Lag results possible (from 6ms to 21ms based on model), **including Dolby Vision and webOS in-built Apps calibration also compatible for Movies and TV Shows**.


These are actual meter based calibration settings using a certified Spectracal C6 meter, Murideo 6G pattern generator, and CalMan for Biz + disc based + direct feedback with both games, tv shows and movies gathered in 5+ years of usage.


Yeah, I know, ""real calibration cannot be copy/pasted from TV to TV as they're all different"" , but tested LG OLED variance between models is much lower then average, and even within a 3% variance you will still experience a much more accurate image compared to default presets, plus CMS and WB advanced options weren't touched, so you're not risking of dialing in wrong values.


There are **6 Profiles** to independently 1-time-Calibrate for each source/content combination, and then forget about it.


In order to do it, just change the video source to the one you want to calibrate (for example: webOS Netflix app, or to HDMI1 connected to Xbox One|Series X / PS4 Pro or PS5) and then load up the type of video content you want to calibrate (for example: launch an SDR Game, or an HDR Game, or a Dolby Vision movie).


Once you're ready, apply those Suggested Presets (click Titles to open the documents, you can also print them for convenience):

 **FOR 2017 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:

 

* [**Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 + SDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHY0Y-5dzfkMj8Xl2XrnOgqSX6FFp04IDd5gv_F699Y/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just stay in the Dashboard Home. All Xbox SDR contents will share the calibration;


* [**Xbox One/Series X|S / PS4 / PS5 + HDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1ArpZ_OOJP2K3oeogB7eou7NRPJlKLxpEc6kI5Yguk/edit) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: Try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open ""Insects"" Demo or any other HDR game. All Xbox HDR contents will share the calibration


* [**Xbox One/Series X|S + Dolby Vision Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D62pGcvPfOQN3mh_j11PYwh1thF-JPOu5cHlB9tVzdI/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*:  try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app and launch a DV movie. All Xbox One Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + SDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zvUD2Tue-GyQJuCpW3pPAOTZ-YlHhqHKTjf4ri1Ngw4/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any SDR content to start calibrating, for example just open Netflix app from your LG remote. All webOS SDR contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + HDR Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J7Ov1kKmrA-Z_oyX5Gj4O-YzI_75tboxrKbRNoFOxYM/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any HDR content to start calibrating, for example just open YouTube app from your LG remote, and search for any HDR videos. All webOS HDR contents will share the calibration; 


* [**webOS + Dolby Vision Calibrated Settings**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dKwavl6b5eHh9ylQFKBQLD08rhQNcDMEiWnM4J3x6hw/edit?usp=sharing) (**Recommended**) - *Note*: try to launch any Dolby Vision content to start calibrating, for example open Netflix app from your LG remote, and start playing ""Altered Carbon"" show. All webOS Dolby Vision contents will share the calibration.; 


*These settings are tailor made and compatible with ALL 2017 LG OLEDs variants (e.g. LG B7, C7, E7, G7, W7). For newer series' settings, read below.* .


 **FOR 2018 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:

Use the same settings for 2017 series above, then apply the following changes:

* **HDR Game** preset: set Color value back from 60 to 55; set Dynamic Contrast: OFF; set Dynamic Tone Mapping: ON;


* **Dolby Vision** preset: change OLED Light value from 50 to 100.





**FOR 2019 to 2022 LG OLED SERIES ONLY**:


* Use ""PC"" HDMI Icon for your HDMI devices in order to unlock 4:4:4 Chroma Subsampling for both SDR and HDR (You can change the HDMI icon going into ""TV Home Dashboard"" and then ""All Inputs"" section);
* See/Print and Apply the following [**2019-2022 Overall Settings Chart**](https://i.imgur.com/2FiNBnT.png)


Also don't forget to **Calibrate ""system-wide HDR"" both for Xbox and Playstation** consoles by following these instructions:

* [**Xbox HDR Calibration app - HDR Optimized Settings**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/63781208)

* [**Playstation HDR Calibration app - HDR Optimized Settings**](https://www.patreon.com/posts/63780325)


Now you're ready to enjoy the best visual quality out of your LG OLED (2017 to 2022 series) and your gaming consoles. 

Enjoy :)

PS4,tfi8jk,Jedi: Fallen order performance on Ps4?,"I have the 1tb base Ps4.

I'm thinking of buying Jedi: Fallen order but i have heard it has some performance issues on Ps4. 

For those of you who have played it on Ps4, how bad are the issues? Is it ocassional frame drops like in FromSoftware games or is it barely playable?"
PS4,tfhj3z,PS4 monitor?,"I have tried to find the answer but I‚Äôm lost. So. I play on PS4 only. Not the pro. I‚Äôve been playing on an old Samsung 60hz monitor for a long long time and if works great -but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôm borrowing so I need one of my own, and this one is out of production.
I just got the Lenovo g27q-20 and I love almost everything about it, (especially color since good color coverage is really important to me -like top priority) except the fact that it seems to be lagging. It‚Äôs a 165 hz screen with freesync but I know PS4 can‚Äôt do more than 60 and doesn‚Äôt support freesync. The new monitor has more lag than my old one did, which sucks but why? Is it because the new monitor can‚Äôt keep up at that low hz?
And what do I do? Would I be better off with a monitor that is clocked at 60 and not any higher?
I‚Äôm new to this so all this screen stuff is super confusing."
